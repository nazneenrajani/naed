Moreover , great power was wielded by the regional and civic elite of that world , and gladiatorial contests went hand in hand with maintaining that power .

The evidence for this is that the sediments from warmer periods have lower levels of the carbon isotope 13 C .

Comrade P also escaped from the dead hands of the Japanese butchers . We have to make a deep reverence to this old Bolshevik who not only showed his great abilities and courage in the face of emergencies , but went hand in hand with us even under the most dangerous wartime conditions .

The immediate need is to get to grip with the Act and work out exactly what it means , take that knowledge and turn it in to a form that my colleagues and the councilors will readily understand . Plain English and Acts of Parliament never seem to go hand in hand .

This can mean working across the whole organisation -- staff , volunteers , trustees and service users -- or it can involve only one section , such as the senior management team , or a disaffected sector of the client group .

Art is as basic as food , shelter and sex , and many people believe that art and religion started at roughly the same time . And both go hand in hand for nearly two millennia .

Every month or so , some manufacturer lands a LED Torch on our desk and professes to be the next best thing since sliced bread !
