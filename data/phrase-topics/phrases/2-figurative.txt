Class unity , the prerequisite of a real end to the Troubles , can never be achieved on the basis of sectarian politics , only on the basis of class politics . This unity does not mean taking upissues and ignoring the more contentious questions like parades , justice , policing or the National Question . These issues are only sectarian because they are taken up sectarians who do so in a one sided and often very provocative manner .


Too often in the recent past culture has been an optional extra , something to be supported after everything else has received their share . Too often it has been seen as a privilege for the elite , or as something that somehow was n't sufficiently.

Unfortunately , however , such views demonstrate the philistinism and economism which dominate the British left . Preferring to tell the working class to focus on theirstruggles , the left has little or nothing to say about the monarchical system that is central to the operation of the British capitalist state .

We have expressed our doubts that this unique form of devolved government could succeed with it irreconcilable , political and philosophical emphasis .

It 's great to read Tony Campolo 's interview ( thanks to Jenee and textweek for this link ) in which he claims that Evangelical Christianity has been hijacked by the Religious Right , to support their political , social and economic agenda .

While the UK stainless wire producers have indeed attempted to focus on these niche markets , they are not of themselves sufficient to permit profitable operations .

If you are tempted to use a Marina block , ensure you fit the mounting bolts , as sometimes the drilling breaks through into the crankcase , and you end up with a super oil leak .

Morris Marina engines certainly did not power any airships , but they did move millions of saloon cars .


It would be naive to suggest that I sit in my room playing endless Killers , Bloc Party , Kaiser Chiefs but my passion in playing them was that the majority of Popart showed passion in return .

That requires becoming actively involved not only with keeping software secured and updated , but recognising and understanding Internet security trends as a whole .

The election gives us the opportunity to hear points of view , which will help us to grill the various candidates about their attitudes towards the European Union .

They will leave their mark for years to come . But it will be theissues on the economy and public services that will shape public views . Here we need to chart a clear course , both in setting our vision and in making progress towards it .


But I 'm trying to de-mystify the monopoly that TUC unions seem to hold over so-called workplace organisation .

70 % of all horses running had a different jockey riding last time compared to today . Sometimes trainers change jockeys because they want to use the services of an apprentice , or not , or because they may want a top class jockey to ride today whilst in previous races ajockey has done the steering . It should therefore be possible to identify trainers who are good at certain jockey changes .


They really need repeat fees for re-use of programme notes they have penned . We meet to discuss and decidematters three times a year for about 90 minutes maximum .

Why ca n't these rich , famous people be content with life 's generous gifts , instead of silting up the recording studios and television talk shows with their musical offerings ? Even writers - who ought to know better - form bands which take thefrom impoverished musicians .

" The independent grocers who once were the main buyers of local goods have fallen from 62,000 in 1977 to 23,960 in 2001 and are still in decline .

It says it 's all right for everything to be done and dusted at party group meetings without having the chore of being dragged into a public forum .
