But sadly , the FA does not want to. They quote five reasons : The English are represented by the Great Britain football team , and that 's representation enough .


One study ( Encounters with unjust authority , Gamson , Fireman and Rytina 1982 , quoted in Atkinson et al , ( 1990 ) showed a considerable amount of rebellion on the part of groups . In their experiment 16 out of 33 groups totally refused to do what was expected of them and in a further 9 groups the majority of group members refused to. Their experiment appears to show two important factors at work in the development of rebellion : defining the situation and conformity .

Or is it a page which only you are allowed to see .

I 'll also be selling signed copies of my book , The Mysterious Double Sunset , at3 ( less than 25 % of the original retail price !


That this war is not about oil is laughable . The US was very willing to have The Taliban control Afghanistan until it became obvious that the Taliban were not going towith regard to the proposed pipeline carrying oil through Afghanistan . So , in a nutshell , the USA was willing to turn a blind eye to one of the most repressive regimes the world has ever known , so long as it could get the pipeline built .


It 's this : Hitler 's goal is the occupation and annexation of a vast part of Russia . How are you going towith a man who covets your house and intends to settle in it if he can , even if he has to hit you over the head with his bat ? And moreover says so .

Again , if there were any attempt to amend that , the Secretary of State would not give consent to the Bill . The Deputy Chairperson : In other words , he is not prepared to. Mr Stewart : I would not put it as starkly as that .


With the G.B. I truly did not worry . We had done all we could and I knew in my bones that the old girl would, and she did . With a loud report , the 48 in wide by 1 in thick steel stringer plates we had fitted at various deck levels buckled , the ship straightened and the gap completely closed .


Both days the sun shone , the winds stayed almost nil . If a few of the small Carp hadit would have been a fantastic day for the boys and girls . My thanks go out to Terry Barton , Roy Oliver , Ray Martin and Colin Read for taking time off to help .


This was probably one of the bravest decisions we ever made . Our fears were : would the suppliers, would the suppliers improve their terms ; would the quality of service improve and the hardest of them all was , would the end-users support us ? Sometimes in procurement you have to take calculated risks .


In the longer term I 'll decide what I keep -- but first I need to list exactly what I 've got , and reunite long divided sets of this , that and the other . Technology bites back Various bits of the software I 've been using for years is now refusing to. Hot Metal Pro keeps on hanging , so I 'm ending up editing this in OpenOffice .

I am still planning a road trip next week with Tacy and new recruit to the posse , Calamity-Jane Cann . Should be fun if the weather! The internet is still awash with scandal and gossip about the girl that beat me at the worlds....Its quite entertaining seeing what rubbish people can write about her .


You'll also need to secure his agreement but , as I said , ask him at the right time and that shouldn't be a problem . And if he won't, you can always enter our competition to win all of the fabulous prizes we have selected . Come on England , as they say .


Also the computer stuff should be simpler than it is . When you invest time in something , you expect that thing toand reach a state of success . If the problems arise because things are just harder than you thought , then fair enough .


Huge differences between US and British commanders ( kept secret for decades afterwards ) were exacerbated by a number of factors . Firstly the Germans did n't. Despite a muddled command structure and Hitler 's orders for not an inch of ground to be given up , the Wehrmacht used the ' bocage ' ( grove ) country of Normandy brilliantly to hang on for months after the initial landing .


And that being the case I will be choosing my merchants very carefully from now on in .

And bookmark his blog while you 're there .


One year on and our civil liberties and human rights are going down the pan . The state/cops shoot first and ask questions months later , whilst the mainstream media. If you aren't white you could well be a terrorist or illegal immigrant , so they'll stick you in a detention centre anyway just in case .


I 've also been trying to use the elephant gag for about the same length of time . No-one willwith me in conversation . It goes like this : it 's raining .


I started off on the bends which had always produced good fish in recent years , but this year did n't seem anywhere like previous seasons ! After an hour of moving from swim to swim , some 30 ’ 40 ft at a time , I found some fish that wanted to. My first fish out was a small fish of just under the pound mark but pretty all the same .

In another twist to this sad tale , Swansea City 's creditors list include both the Football League and Carlton ! Looking on the bright side , even if Granada and Carltonand honour the Agreement , clubs must be under no illusion that the goose that laid this golden-egg has a shelf life of only two more seasons . The next contract , with whichever TV Company , will be worth a fraction of the current contract to each League club .


! Cain finds out about these travesties but - predictably - is persuaded toand assist the overacting Combs once he realises the heart of his true love ( Meg from the original film ) has been preserved . And so , the James Whale-esque bride is created as Meg 's heart is amalgamated with the brain of a terminally ill patient Cain has since become obsessed with .


How does the SAR-715 do it ? Initially , I was unable to get the router towith XP , but in the course of doing the review , I reset it to the factory defaults and configured the router again . Surprisingly XP reported a device called Virtata IGD ( Internet Gateway Device ) in the My Network Places window ( it also appeared as an Internet Connection under Network connections ) .


It is now a useful tool for companies , incorporating the ethos of Higgs et al . However , if companies are willing toit is important that investors are ready to catch it . " She was concerned that in many cases institutional investors did not have the resources to take up the role given to them in the Code and felt that too much power might be put in the hands of investor bodies like the ABI as shareholders would rely on them for advice .


It would be laughable were it not such a serious issue . So cut the PB 's some slack - I think they did their job on this - if HMRC wo n'tthere is little they can do . Sheila Pyatt , 4-Dec-2005 CIOT It should come as no surprise that our learned body are not playing any leading light in all this .


As might be expected , the cry of " conspiracy ! " was raised as soon as the scientists refused to. To be fair , there are several photos that do show something big and bright in the region of Hale-Bopp , but why is it there in some of them and not in others ?

Flossie is a born show-off and is never happier than when she is the star-attraction . Certainly she is at her most appealing when she decides she wants to. This is usually reserved for those times when we have friends round for dinner and Flossie will bring out her selection of grubby , hairy , half-eaten rubber balls .


If you run with the " in crowd " , you get points for it . Regardless of what I think about the system , I decided to "" in order to get my websites listed well in the directories .

The organisation 's first chief of staff had enjoyed reasonably good contacts with the Libyan regime in the early and middle Eighties , while a senior quartermaster in the IRA . But , when formal approaches were made , Libya refused to.

For affiliate marketing to be successful it has to operate as a two way street , a partnership between affiliates and merchants . Networks like Tradedoubler can do their best to help both parties , but unless the merchantsthen the best content in the world wo n't earn me a penny . And that being the case I will be choosing my merchants very carefully from now on in .


Perhaps some HE-ers could band together and foot their own candidates - maybe the solution is standing and seeing how many people interested . Heather Says : April 16th , 2005 at 1:11 pm I understand the argument about not ' wanting to vote for any of ' em ' but sometimes this refusal toonly favours the likes of the BNP . It smacks of the toddler strops to me .


It uses Absolute Positioning and uses the recommendation that an Absolutely Positioned ( AP ) element will " calculate " its height from its containing block providing the containing block is not position : static ; ( default ) . Of course IE does n'twith this recommendation but we can use some of its little quirks to encourage the same effect. there is a " floaty " one coming soon too . .


Big engined moderns and classics that did n'tI 've never had much joy with fuel calculations . The Series 1 Jaguar XJ12 L I had some years back was also fairly vague in its reported fuel levels , manys the time it coasted to a halt sucking only fumes from either of its twin tanks .


They wanted to fish well and really enjoy doing it . They had all been around carp fishing long enough to know that occasionally even if you put in loads of effort , fish really well and conditions are perfect , you can still be slapped down by Mr Carp refusing to. With everyone set up and in place it was only minutes before Geoff in peg 5 was away and blow me down whilst we were photographing a 10-8 , his other alarm burst into life !


The research defines segments of the population in relation to how protective they are ; pensioners in the lower socio-economic grades are most likely to be Guarded Privatists whereas those at the other end of the age spectrum are more likely to be Open all hours . Luckily the bulk of individuals are in the pragmatic middle ground , if you give them a good reason to deliver up their data , and do n't abuse it , they just might. There is a real budgetary imperative too .


Apparently I 'm not the only one with this problem though . I have an iMac G5 connecting to a Netgear wireless router and Tiger just refuses towith the DHCP , the Airport keeps assigning itself an IP address . It works fine through Ethernet though - I guess I 'll have to wait for a fix .


A well-executed technique is very often visually striking to those who witness it . In a real fight , the opponent will not "" in the same way a compliant practice partner would and hence the technique will not be as pretty in appearance . What is a graceful movement when performed in the kata , or against a compliant practice partner , will become rough round the edges when applied in an all out situation .


Start the GMS idea of points means prizes . Give the carrot MPIG so no-one loses out and they all. Set the minimum targets of 25 % ( to get the ball rolling ) .


Nor did workers worry about using working hours to hunt down food and other necessities . If mangers did not, the labour shortage meant they had no compunction about flitting from job to job in order to search out better conditions . Demoralised , hungry , badly trained and yet prepared to cock a snook at management , workers ' productivity was bound to suffer .


Do n't you know who I am ? Only the President of this whole fucking shitpile that 's who ' - or whatever the Arabic equivalent of that might be , and now he 's even decided not toat all and turn to his own show trial . And so we come to Marcus over at Harry 's Place who 's clearly incensed by Saddam 's behaviour and worried that if he keeps acting up it might harm ' the credibility of the Iraqi judiciary and the legal process.

Something has to give . And I may have the solution , although I do n't know if work will, so I 'll keep that under my hat for a bit until I 've discussed it with them , and blog you an update when I have . Comments ( 1 ) 9/2/2006 Bad Head Day Filed under : General -- Jenny @ 9:44 pm Hmmm , probably not surprising after the week I 've had , spent most of the day on the sofa with the curtains pulled and the tv on very low with yet another migraine .


If in doubt , check with your supervisor . We always have the sanction of removing people 's access to the network if they do n'tbut we do n't enjoy doing this ! CLEANLINESS AND ORDER I tried to think of a title to this section slightly less reminiscent of Sunday School , ( " Control of Extraneous and Unidentifiable Materials on Working Surfaces " ?


Meghan O'Sullivan , a fellow at the Brookings Institution , said the best approach would be to give up sanctions which do not work in exchange for allied support for those which do . ` ` They should bargain away what 's not in place for what is in place , to show we are willing to, ' ' she said . The United States could offer , for example , to let foreign oil companies invest in the Iraqi oil industry in return for a commitment that their governments would stick to the rules .


Continuing our vague theme of electricity , we got a science kit out this morning . Failed to demonstrate static properties with balloons which would n't, but we had success with the circuits . Nothing really new today , I think it was just consolidation of stuff we 'd already covered by playing with the electronics kit , but it was fun anyway .


The difficulty for United now is that the Dutchman has his heart set on a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona , not Italy . At the present time neither Spanish side is, with Real Madrid in the middle of a Presidential election and Barcelona 's efforts focused on United misfit Diego Forlan . Ruud , it appears , has also decided to use the World Cup as a stage for his talents - a strategy that could back-fire for both the player and United should it all go wrong .


It 's a question of money which is easily overcome , but more important for me is to lose some weight . I 've set myself a goal of losing a stone by Christmas and I 'd like to lose another stone before I start treatment ( so that 'll be sometime in 2007 then ) Lisa - bummer about AF - she neverdoes she ?

Some of the things the CLA would propose include a series of new linear routes across open country , new legislation on occupiers , better control over dogs and public behaviour , more Ranger services and improvements to the rights of way legislation . They are convinced that landowners will= if the system is voluntary .

Christopher Chick and his girlfriend Helen Morris later retracted their evidence saying police put pressure on them . Mr Chick also said police had offered him5,000 for giving evidence against the men but was then refused it as he " had n't" . Barristers acting for Michael O'Brien , Ellis Sherwood and Darren Hall asked the three Appeal Court judges to rule that their convictions were unsafe because a confession by one of them could not be relied on .


I ca n't think of many venues in the country where the chub average OVER 5lb in weight , yet the Relief channel still receives very little attention . So , the next time the River Lea is low and clear and the barbel are n'twhy not get a little relief ?


Just like all albums before , they manage to take you someplace and keep you there for the duration of the album . The title track of any album sets the tome and it 's up to the rest of the tracks to. And in the case of Blue Bell Knoll ( the album ) , the effect is amazing .


Out have gone most of the troublesome Trots . The CPB wo n't, the Greens have refused an electoral pact for the Euro elections , and the Socialist Party claims it 's all insufficiently socialist . In their place , the SWP has made a pitch for big names and big forces - the anti-war movement , the anti-capitalist movement , George Galloway and the Muslim community .

The first thing Paul says here is that you should " submit " . You should, in so far as Caesar is not playing God . And that includes all that Paul talks about in verses 6 and 7 : This is also why you pay taxes , for the authorities are God 's servants , who give their full time to governing. { 7 } Give everyone what you owe him : If you owe taxes , pay taxes ; if revenue , then revenue ; if respect , then respect ; if honour , then honour .


Consequences Following the discussions described in the documents , the British Foreign Secretary , Anthony Eden , did indeed meet the German ambassador and make his proposals . Hitler refused toand kept up his bluff . France was on the verge of a general election and would not act without Britain ; Britain did nothing ; Hitler got away with it .


That seems reasonable , does n't it ? Given that we agree with the principle of ·the polluter pays ' this is OK in principle , but good landlords are treated the same way as the bad in the plans ( and if the bad do n't, the good have to pay the bill , too. ) There are perverse incentives for local authorities to view this as a way of raising money . Designating an area will stigmatise it ( or even worse , glorify it for some ) and many , many other arguments of detail .


The execution of peaceful protesters by a brutal authoritarian state was captured on television , most notably with the iconic figure of ' The Tank Man ' , and resulted in worldwide condemnation . But do people remember the Bobur Square Massacre , at the height of The War Against Terror when the west was prepared to break bread with any brutal dictator who was prepared to? .


A. You could have a claim on his pension however without all the information then it is difficult to advise . I would suggest that you go and see a solicitor who could perhaps write a letter to your husband to advise that you wish to seek a capital settlement and that you would consent to the petition if he agreed toon the finances . Its not ideal but it could be a way of having matters dealt with .


DAMMIT why did n't the UK get all of Jus 's costumes ? Other issues.. the lads are n't playing America , cos by all accounts Atlantic are n't, and there has n't been any significant promotion of the album over there . Not surprisingly , there are some very vocal and organised protests going on .


Some time later , Ken Purdy phoned General Smith . " General , if the Air Force wants to talk to us off the record , we 'll. True will either handle it from then on whatever way you think best or we 'll keep still .


It can also be the best move as it will cut out the possible exit fees from them and the arrangement fees from the new lender . Take out a new loan If your own lender wo n't, go for the deal you want . There 's nothing to stop you taking out a mortgage yourself if you 've done the research .


Should Minnie go or should she stay ? All 10-year-old Minnie Cruttwell wants to do is play with the boys , but the Football Association are not. She is a member of a mixed team called Balham Blazers , but the FA say she must join a girls ' team when she is 12 .


What if the shoe were on the other foot ? Let us say that the Claimant has a good case and R refuses to. The answer is easy - the Claimant makes a Part 36 offer and then issues proceedings .


" Sprout " and " Chive " were convinced that the Germans had help from Major Bingham , then the Dutch section 's head . " No one else was in such a good position to '' with the enemy , " Chive told his MI5 interviewers . The British author of the memo was clearly angered by the assertion .

" from the other side of the green screen , I began to fantasise about having a life-size dolly on my hands and , for the first time since Pippa , someone who I could dress and redress to my heart 's content . It never occurred to me that dolly might not want to. I think what lies at the heart of our problem is that while I harbour secret ambitions to dress her like one of the Pevensie Sisters she wants to go out looking like Jodie Foster as she appeared in Taxi Driver .


April 04 : Mark Aizlewood has had his contract as Ian Rush 's number two at Chester City terminated . The club are n't playing well and are facing financial problems , and also want to get rid of boss Ian Rush , but his legal team are n't.

The views continued at the top of Rattlinghope , which was cleaned by the entire field . Gattens Gamble was more challenging as the start was on a steep muddy bank which stopped all the class fives and few others as well , including the DAF of Fred Mills and Derek Reynolds whose Variomatic transmission wouldn»t. Adstone was next , after a hairy downhill approach road with extremely deep ruts on the right , which leaned the cars right over into the trees lining the track .


After 6 months of not leaving my computer and a bum moulded to the shape of my swivel chair , and a distinct feeling of public pressure - a fixed arrival date that would n't allow for delays of the I had a blister/got lost/bored/broke my neck sort . Damn , I had to do this , without a stove , no money for snacks en-route or the bus and no idea if my tendons would. Oh , and the photographs .


A seemingly small fish swirled on the surface and was easily drawn to the margins , when suddenly it began to wake up . We were all excited to see our fist carp but she did n't want tojust yet . Eventually though the tackle began to take its toll and a gorgeous big golden flanked common carp rolled on the surface .


Get around to buying a second usb drive to backup the first . Not that i 'm paranoid about backups now or anything ;- ) Work on getting Tiger towith my wireless router so my Airport Express can be used . So , If anyone can recommend some decent , cheaper alternative backup software , that would be good .


That was good enough for me , so out they went . Ca n't Wait To Get Back I 'd love to report that we went on to bank a few more fish , but they decided they were n't going toany more , and my fish was the only action we were to experience on our all-too-short session there . So , one fish between us was a small return for our efforts , but we all enjoyed ourselves and I for one will be returning for another go .


We took a track through the wood , firstly hearing a distant Grey-headed Bush-Shrike , before getting close views of a couple African Pied Hornbills . Then a calling Yellow-throated Leaflove could be heard , but it did n't want to, however some time later we finally caught up with it or another bird perched on top of a palm tree . Raptors were much in evidence , with Palm-nut Vulture , African Harrier-Hawk , Lizard Buzzard , and a flyover African Hobby .


Under the ATPDEA , Peru won some significant trade concessions that have benefited some exporters of textiles and clothing .

Not wanting to push my luck , I asked him to act like he knew me , shake my hand warmly and offer some friendly parting words . To my amazement and relief , he was happy to. I returned to my lady friend with renewed optimism for what the night held in store .


A spunk packed film bursting with unbelievably cocky , fit , European straight lads . These lads are gagging to pull out their cocks and, and with the lads being lads if there 's a spare hole around some of them do n't mind giving it a good hard stuffing ?

Slimming pills , chins , busty blondes/brunettes with an eye on a tabloid splash : you name it , Warney has doubled up . So only the slowest dullard could have failed to spot the significance behind Warne 's rage at the Rose Bowl on Saturday evening , after the Kent captain Robert Key refused toand take up Warne 's offer of a run chase on the last day of his side 's championship match with Hampshire . First , the history .


Clients had a great time . Even the weather. " Highland Fling , Winton House , May 2006 HBOS " We were entirely happy with every aspect of the organisation of this event .


Driving up and the track we located the area , but not before Trevor almost got us stuck in a ditch trying a particularly ambitious 3-point turn ! Unfortunately the sparrows were n't, although we did get flight views of one darkish bird that Trevor thought " looked good " . But not good enough to confirm .
