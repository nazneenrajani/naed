I used to have a badly-paid job in a field in which I had always wanted to work , but eventually I got so disillusioned that I left , retaining my interest , but utterly sick of the everyday annoyances .

However , it is effective and while the story did n't move me in the way novels such as Sophie 's Choice or Midnight 's Children , it did leave me very angry and even more entrenched in my views that unfettered capitalism is a very bad thing indeed .

Henry , who is being linked with a summer switch to the Catalan side , thinks it will be a tight game with perhaps only one goal being scored , despite the entertaining reputation of both sides . "it 's about winning , whether you play well or do n't play well , " he said .
