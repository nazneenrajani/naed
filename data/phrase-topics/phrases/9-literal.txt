Q : Does Reference3D include a DEM or a DTM ? A : The processing of stereoscopic images ( space or aerial ) naturally produces a DEM , because neither the operator nor the matching software can see the ground itselfand leaves . If a DTM is really requested , a very labour intensive correction process has to be undergone , to eliminate the trees and buildings , and we cannot guaranty the accuracy of the result without field checking .


More than half the game involves the use of vehicles , which range from a police bike and police cars to actual Skynet vehicles .

Because the biggest beam has put on weight - it is now 354kg .

I remember the time when Alex was working on the cowshed roof . He 'd excavated similar buildings from the period , but it was only when handling the materials , slotting bendy hazel rodsbeams to create a mesh for the thatch , that he gradually appreciated the various properties and so potential of his tool-kit . Back in the 17th century , wood was a resource of paramount importance .

What had caused the fire was nothing of a mystery although it was thought it started in the gallery at the west end . One opinion was that it may have been caused by the large heating stove which was at the west end of the north aisle from which the flue ran up, although the woodwork was not so badly damaged there . There was more damage on the south side .


Equally important is being careful to avoid unnecessary heat losses or overheating and consideration can be given to reducing these and saving money and also helping to reduce the effects of climate change . In a typical British home , around one-third of the heat produced by a central heating system is rapidly lost, ceiling and walls . This does not have to happen : simple insulation measures can eliminate this loss almost completely .
