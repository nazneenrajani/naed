There is really only one answer should England continue to prosper . Strauss may be a safe pair of hands ( though he keptyesterday ) but if Flintoff is still enjoying the captaincy and , crucially , is still craving the job , then it becomes well-nigh impossible for the selectors to take it away from him . England want Flintoff in Australia a happy man .

Botha opened the scoring with this first kick on four minutes after a good drive from the pack . Full back Peter Baird missed with a penalty and the home side should have increased their lead but scrum half Simon Cahillgoing over the line after a slick handling move which involved Chris Henry , Mark McBrian and Botha .

And their bravery was rewarded when Milan goalkeeper Dida handed them victory with a shocking last-minute error .

" Ford added : " There are some things we will have to look at this week in training as they broke through a few times . You could say we were lucky that heover the line , but on the other hand it was good work by Dan to keep chasing him down and to make the tackle . In this game you often make your own luck .


The goalkeeper is different , because the Law requires a goalkeeper to be present on the field of play for each team , and that is why the goalkeeper is usually treated on the field of play .

But normally , a member of the opposition will offer ( in the spirit of the game ) to touch the dropped ball back to the goalkeeper .

However , we came through , and to see the look on Clive Woodward 's face when Wilko scored was beautiful .


This manoeuvre is more likely to be an accident , rather than instigated on purpose by the throwing player . This is no different to when a player taking a throw-in in wet conditions , accidentallyon the ground outside of the touchline , and it rolls into the field of play .

Crumlin United:0Queen 's :2(after extra time ) QUEEN'S should have gone in front but their finishing let them down .

Foot cleared an inside ball . Ademolawhich number 7 pinched away from him and fed it easily to the midfielders who was unmarked . Number 2 easily nudged the ball against the swaying net prompting a Danish fan to start a red flare .


For me , there were far too many knock ons / dropped passes etc. From what I could see - this was due to players passing the ball rather than taking the hit . Leeds were up on Bedford and alot of the time , with the man receiving the pass being tacked at the same time - causing the player to. Players were to slow to support a tackled player - leaving them isolated .

Alloa later got a consolation via a wicked deflection which was an unfortunate way for Montrose to lose their first goal in 581 minutes of football .


Sometimes this will work but we must all realise what the team is trying to achieve . Another option would be toout pull the defence forward . This would create more space in behind them and allow your forwards to open the game up .


Andrew Mumford supplied a cross from the left . Flahavan , under pressure from Neil Sharp , should have caught it but heand there was Todd to poke home from close range for his second goal in three games . But another goalkeeping error - this time from Roger Freestone - allowed the Essex side to equalise in the sixth minute .


With the Robins very much in the ascendancy , Morell Maison introduced Stuart Blaik to the game in place of Primus on the hour mark . Reece 's free kick , that restarted the game following the substitution , saw Yeomanson , unchallenged ,into his own net and gift Stones the lead . Nathan Bailey replaced the injured Darby for his first game back since he broke his toe and this only gave the Stones defense more problems .


Attacking , defensive and other heading techniques have their own sections . The aim of the control header is toto feet as soon as possible . Make contact with the ball in the centre of your forehead , and use your whole body as a shock absorber to cushion the ball .


Building on this lack of firepower , Halton were the first to draw blood . A high ball delivered from the left was caught by the Benson keeper , but a collision with his full back caused him to, leaving Priestley the opportunity to bury the ball into an empty net to give the home side the lead . Whilst Halton still seemed the more comfortable through the middle , with Cpl Ben Sammutt instrumental in most of their play , the goal seemed to galvanise Benson into action .


Bradford took advantage within seconds as Henderson went through some feeble Quins defence to bury his way over . Bradford 's habit of conceding penalties andearly in the tackle count undermined their efforts though and it was Harlequins who stepped up the pace to score . Leuluai stepped through some weak Bulls tackling to go over , and the Kiwi could have grabbed another minutes later but he put the returned Gafa 's short pass down as the pitch opened up for him .


Emphasise to the " heads " to vary their lead -- some fast , some slow , some sideways , some stopping , etc. I let one lead for about 20 seconds or so . Then , on a whistle from a coach , 2to 3 and becomes the head of the snake . The rattle ( 3 ) becomes the dribbler and the former head circles around to become the rattle .


When the skipper looked up to see the dog standing there , he said " Hello Caesar . " At which point Caesardown splat into a drum of dirty diesel , covering the skiper with the smelly stuff . The language that spurted out was ripe but Caesar thought it was fun .


This flexibility allows the Referee to make a decision based on the individual incident . If a goalkeeper goes down injured with the ball still in his hands , to restart the game , an astute Referee willto the goalkeeper alone . If play is stopped because a dog has entered the filed , then two opponents can contest the dropped ball .


In the modern game , Referees discourage players from kicking lumps out of each other ; there rarely is little justification for a contested dropped ball . The procedure is simple in Law 8 : in a large number of cases , the Refereeat the place where it was located when play was stopped . The players themselves seem to appreciate this last vestige of gentlemanly behaviour , and it is rarely a problem .


A dropped ball does not have to be completed with a set number of players in attendance . In fact the Referee couldwith no players around him . Therefore , Referees in such volatile situations as in the match you mention , would just drop the ball back to the goalkeeper ( or a defender if it was outside of the penalty area ) - after telling all of the attacking players to keep well out of the way .


The wicketkeeper ran up and ran back . Heand then threw it to the bowler , who was n't looking . Eventually , and owing to no skill on anyone 's part , Ruef was run out .

Lord no ! Meads went for every shot ,at every opportunity he had , and retrieved and defended beautifully . Berrett just kept on playing long rallies , keeping the ball in play as long as he could , sending his opponent on walks around the park clockwise , anticlockwise , back and forth .
