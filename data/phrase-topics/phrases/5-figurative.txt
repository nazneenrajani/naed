I was gutted , it was a proper run , line coming off the spool but I felt nothing , all I could think was that might be my only chance of the week and I had fluffed it . I laid the rod against the bivvy , it was six o clock and still dark , so I decided to getfor an hour until it was light . I got up when it was light , had the obligatory visit to the bushes and then went to see if Barry had caught anything , he reported nothing so I told him about my miss .

Saints returned from Ross-shire on Saturday with all three pointsbut players and supporters alike were left frustrated that they had n't rung up their most emphatic win of the season .

Yet another route that wildfowling charts towards sound mental health is that the pursuit of wild fowl in wild places conditions us to coping with failure . Someone once calculated that a coastal fowler had a one-in-three chance of finishing a flight with a bird.

Tom seemed to have itup the last beat but sailed into a ' hole ' on the way to the line and Nathan almost sailed past , Tom managed to get moving again to win that race , Simon held Peter off in forth place to secure second overall with Peter third .

Good wins against Leigh and Hull set up a Challenge Cup quarter-final with Wigan in front of a mammoth 20,004 crowd . Unfortunately with the gameon a boggy pitch , a display of inept tactical kicking handed the Riversiders a late victory .

The result was that some pupils believed they had thrown away the qualification by failing to do the coursework ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›Ã’ so they did n't bother to work for , or even attend , the exam . Others who did take the exam were getting lower passes than they need have done by failing to achieve those valuable "" coursework marks . So today Heartlands staff do everything they can think of , including running sessions outside curriculum time , to help students get coursework done .


A long Steve Lomas throw resulted in a goalmouth scramble , in which Sammy Youssouf had a shot blocked , but Nygaard made no mistake as his well-hit shot squirmed under Simonsen . With a goal, the home side played some patient football , with Stoke rarely launching a meaningful attack . The frustration of having to do most of the running must have got to City midfielder Dave Brammer on 24 minutes , and to concede a penalty with Cook going nowhere was absolute madness .


What was I going to take to the Weymouth gathering ? Well , apart from a few clothes there were quite a lot of other things required for the event - paperwork relating to The Folding Society , a few copies of " It 's! " , cameras , and the computer with membership details .


But the win capped a season of disappointment in the league , as rivals Rhyl got the win they needed to lift the Welsh Premier crown . TNS had this gamewithin the first eight minutes . A flurry of attacks produced a goal for John Toner when he raced on to a through ball from Steven Beck , found himself in the clear , and lobbed keeper Steve Goodwin from the edge of the box .


So , what is the latest in this infuriating fiasco ? Well , to be sure they would win the last election , Brown and Blair did agree on something - to bury pensions as an issue by appointing an independent commission - ' Yes Minister ' style - that would not report back until after the cat wasfor the third time . As chairman of the new Pensions Commission , enter Lord Adair Turner , former darling of the CBI and it must be said , not a man to play games with .


A year ago Albion were without a win and had amassed just three points from their opening nine games . This time they go into the international break with 16. That in itself should quell any lingering disappointment about dropped points in Fife .


This race will be remembered as one of the great Tours , largely because Armstrong 's new air of fragility has guaranteed suspense right up to the race 's final weekend for the first time in 14 years .

He was weaker in the mountain stages , fell ill with pleurisy , and assisted a team-mate , Lucien Aimar , to victory .


At least we had not hit the ' wall ' and were all still very cheerful . The Raptor watch point at Welbeck was our next port of call. we knew we had no chance of Honey Buzzard as they have not returned for the past couple of years and we already had Osprey.

Blackwell said : " The last game was just about giving every player here 45 minutes and getting their match fitness up . We have done the running and that 's, it 's that match sharpness that we 're looking at now and what we need are the games for that .

It was like a 2 and a half hour drive followed by a 30 minute hike uphill to a French version of Craigmore , albeit without the midges and the rain . We had to laugh ( eventually ) and got about 5 micro-routes. All in magnificent surroundings it has to be said .


Something must have stirred during this teacher training year ( Bath University ) , as I remember saying to another student that it was quite pretty and all that in Somerset , but I missed seeing a bit of cliff and crag . Jun 1979 : Ben Nevis ( 4A ) With Snowdon and Scafell Pike, I felt it was time to go for the big one . Took it seriously too , buying a one-inch tourist map .


This just shows the effect good managers ( as well as money ) can have at a club . Manchester United and Arsenal are rallying , but they are so far behind Chelsea at the moment it would seem the title is alreadyfor the team from south-west London . Roman Abramovich is boasting that Chelsea will dominate football for a hundred years : I cannot wait to see the decline and fall of this particular Roman Empire .

I would n't go as far to say I 'll stick my neck out and say they 'll definitely win it but definitely be there or there abouts . You wo n't even find Fergie saying that until they 've got itBut we just need to be a bit more consistent , win more , keep winning our home games - or start winning our home games - and just a bit more consistency .

Mighty England crush Paraguay World Cupby Janus Motsonius The England football juggernaut thundered to a stunning victory on Saturday , in the process crushing a hapless Paraguay who could do nothing but stand and stare in wae and wonder at Sven 's merciless sporting elite . The 1-0 scoreline -- courtesy of a virtuoso sixth-minute header by Carlos Gamarra -- left few in any doubt of the World Cup 's final outcome .


Public opinion is against this war , there are considerable reservations among US allies , and Iraq 's neighbours contain populations overwhelmingly opposed . The backing of the UN is important to the White House , and it is not yet. As one Washington Post commentator put it , United Nations support is the multilateralist velvet glove hiding the unilateralist iron fist of the United States .


It was really hot and conditions were really tough . The car has really improved and I got some more pointsso all in all it 's been a really good weekend.ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›Â Gareth Howell also performed well and secured the position of runner-up to Colin in both races .

If we take a glib assumption , that all teams will win their home games , the pressure put on a team playing away first is simple--you have to beat your opponents by more at home than your are beaten away . Simple enough , but if you 're at home first , once you have a win, you can just focus your attention on keeping the score down , defending your lead . The question is whether your team is stronger leading from the start or coming from behind .


The Oxfordshire number three is nationally ranked and proved far to strong for Roseanne and she was well beaten 3-0 . Warwickshire needed to win the next three matches and when Sophie led 2-0 having taken the games comfortably 9-2 , 9-1 it looked as if the first of those matches was. Sophie then lost the third 9-0 and was 3-7 down in the fourth and struggling and it looked as if Warwickshire 's quest for a finals place was over .


After a bit more exploring we found another building similar to the first one we found , again it has found a commercial use . With this oneit was off to Debden . The radar station at Debden We 'd passed Debden on an earlier Airfield Hunting but did n't explore it at the time .


TNS finally got the goal their pressure deserved on 80 minutes , when Lawless fed Chris King who crossed for Marc Lloyd-Williams to head his 26th league goal of the season at the far post . Just when the points seemed to be, Cheesman caught Taylor in possession in the box . Rose fed Craig Williams free on the left and he fired his shot across Doherty and into the net off the foot of the far post .


A lot of people are probably wishing they could emulate him . 07/12/98 Juventas 1 - Galatasaray 1 - Shame really , it looked like the Italians had the gameuntil 2 minutes into injury time when Galatasaray equalised . Probably just as well though .

The third ( and final heat run ) was time to have some fun , so sending the car sideways on the corners was the order of the day , keeping the crowd entertained . A group win , by over six seconds, it 's onto the handicapped heats . Your handicap is based on the time you did to win the group to the fastest car overall .


We got back to the Slig at 7:30pm . 14.5 hours on the hill , 9 out of the 11 Munros. So not too bad .


) and that just added to my anxiety . Not very sensible at all , but it all ended OK with the hilland the good weather holding out . All that remained then was to get down to the Bothy andÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›_erÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›_.do Bothy-type things like sit around drinking copious amounts of beer , be offensive to everyone and fall about a lot .


Last minute television interviews by Don Touhig and Peter Hain glowed with the assurance of victory . One TV reporter assured me that he had been told by an Alun aide on the Friday night that a 5 % Michael victory was. There was one theme only , to shut the mouths of anyone who might criticise the fixes after the result was announced .


It 's! Our P5 pupils interviewed the First Minister today .


The seventh saw Young tear into Bonavic again , with Bonavic trying to stay in close , working away as he did so . And so into the eighth , and a comfortable points win wasas far as Gary Young was concerned , but he was intent on stopping Bonavic . A string of straight rights followed by a fantastic right hook and another straight in the middle of the round and it was indeed all over .

That was a harsh lesson . We were n't expecting the wind to die and we thought that we had it.


Benitez has no interest in Owen , or Joaquin , who he does not rate . Alreadyare Argie centre-back Gabriel Palleta from Banfield , and Chilean winger Mark Gonzalez , who may be asked to play on the right despite being left-footed . On either flank , Gonzalez will be a major star .


) . Everyone else found it hilarious in the extreme , I was completely embarrassed and have not been allowed to forget it since -1 have lost count of the number of times I 've been told " it 's" . All I can say is just-wait until 850 is running-in and I get my revenge , you rotten swine 's !


We 've got to galvanise your own vote . Some people will have thought ' it 's-- it 's a safe Labour seat ' . " C4 again : Defeated Labour candidate Catherine Stihler paid tribute to Rachel Squire as a remarkable woman and a tremendous public servant .


The answers , according to the polls at the moment , would seem to be a clear , although less clear , ' yes ' and ' no ' . If the election is almost '' should the campaign , like last time , be based on safety first ? The 1997 campaign was compared to the agonising feat of carrying a hugely expensive antique vase from one side of the room to another .


Those moments of terror each side of half-time however turned out to be Stoke 's only worthy moments of the entire match . Incredibly and fantastically , by the hour , the game was over and City had 3 pointsthanks to two goals in two minutes to send us completely bonkers . Just before the goal rush , Peter Thorne so nearly scored throwing himself to meet an Ardley cross with a full stretch diving header , the ball just flying over .


Cameron pounced to hook in the rebound when Vio Ganea 's shot from a cross by strike partner Leon Clarke struck both the post and crossbar . Brighton could already have had the pointsby that stage as Wolves yet again struggled to carve out chances . Stefan Postma , making his league debut in goal for the visitors in place of the injured Michael Oakes , was much the busier of the two keepers .


To avoid destroying the column we commenced digging through soft sediment and sand on the RH side . With this year 's Digging Barrel alreadywe did n't really need more cave until New Year 's Day !

Up until Canada ( round 9 ) Alonso had finished either first or second in every single race , including a run of four back-to-back victories . His championship lead was 25 points , and it looked as though it was. And then it all came crashing down .

" That left Pat to disappear into the distance , while Barnes got bogged down with the rest of the lead pack .

" They closed us down well and over-ran us in midfield with their three men against our two . But thankfully the winner 's medal is. " Gretna really were fantastic and dominated for long periods of the game .


And we had the perfect view from right behind the goal . It was not the greatest game ever , and certainly not the easiest three points , but we have themand that 's all we can ask for at the moment . You never know - life could ( I said COULD ) get very interesting from here on .


Nevertheless , there was an exciting finish to conclude proceedings as Thatlldoya repelled Whinny Bank by a neck . Niall Saville 's strength at the business end was crucial as Thatlldoya idled a bit in front , having appeared to have the event. His love of soft ground has meant Thatlldoya has been in his element recently , two second placings being pleasing to the eye .


I question the reasoning here , as it seems primitive at best . Presumably , playing the second leg at home means you can get any result you want , as home games are so much easier ; but if home games are so much easier , why give the psychological advantage of a victoryto the team who plays the first game at home . In last week 's ties , Arsenal went down at Munich , Chelsea at the Nou Camp , Leverkusen at Anfield , Monaco at PSV and Juventus at the Bernabeu .

I do not know how it is that I have kept the following story so long untold . It is one of the curious things that stopfrom which Memory draws out stories at haphazard , like numbers in a lottery .

With the on 180 from 35 overs the brilliant Casey was bowled for 62 , which included 7 4's , and 3 6's . With all the batting pointspark enjoyed the remaining overs and went on to reach 258 for 5 from 45 overs . Eaton topped scored with 69 and N. Welch picked up a nice 38 .


Tied for the lead with three others going into the last 18 holes , he began with a sublime birdie at the opening par three . Confidently striding on to the next tee , the 5ft 4in Welshman could have been forgiven for believing his first Open was. Unfortunately , his bag was already rather cluttered , with 15 clubs , to be exact - one more than is permitted .


Personally I would not discount The Cheeky Girls who have managed to hold steady on their sales for a second week while releasing a new poster calendar format this week . I certainly do n't hold to the opinion that it isfor the boys - all is there to play for . So there you have it - my money is on Girls Aloud to be the 2002 Christmas chart topper .


The final was a tense affair with the favourites still Fletcher/Gregory but not by a huge margin . The first two games were a relatively quick affair , 12-6 12-4 , and it looked as if it wasfor F/G . However , perhaps complacency and fatigue crept in , but certainly Steve and Andrew showed great determination and fought back to snatch the third game 12-8 .


We felt Batts was holding the ball up well , so it was between Buts and Barney , and Buts has just come back from a serious injury so we decided to give him a bit of a rest . " With a play-off place, many managers would be looking to rest key players , but Dave does n't have that luxury . He explained : " Thankfully our next game is a week away - if it was on Tuesday I think JT might have had to make a comeback !


It is probably fair to say that impeded Ranen Michael Schumacher today . Ranen looked like he had 2 nd, but Ferrari 's tactician Ross Brawn came up with a genius plan which gave Michael Schumacher one lap on a clear track to overtake Kimi in the pits . Schumacher did his duty and set the timing screen alight .


We 're improving all the time and starting to see the results of all the hard effort .
