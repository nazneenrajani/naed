61862	drop the ball	literally	Crumlin United:0Queen 's :2(after extra time ) QUEEN'S should have gone in front but their finishing let them down .

115809	drop the ball	literally	Bradford took advantage within seconds as Henderson went through some feeble Quins defence to bury his way over . Bradford 's habit of conceding penalties and <b>dropping</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> early in the tackle count undermined their efforts though and it was Harlequins who stepped up the pace to score . Leuluai stepped through some weak Bulls tackling to go over , and the Kiwi could have grabbed another minutes later but he put the returned Gafa 's short pass down as the pitch opened up for him .

155703	under the microscope	literally	The remainder of the week was spent with Prof. Ed Derbyshire , looking at various aspects of glacial sedimentology . Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the two days ( in my view anyway ) involved looking at till micromorphology , both <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> ( thin sections ) and with the SEM . Other aspects of the unit included detailed lectures about till fabrics and whether or not fabric analysis can elucidate transport pathways ( the group were divided ) .
