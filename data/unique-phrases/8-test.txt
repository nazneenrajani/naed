I will bet him twenty to one , and let any New York publisher hold the stakes , that the statements I have above made as to the authorship of the article in question are entirely true .

Moaning about the worst sin in our godless Britain being envy , of all things .

You might have a good slam dunker or a stealer and building the right team is the key to success . Once you 've beaten an opposing team you can rub it in further by stealing one of their players ( ideally their best player ) to play for you and you can have up to five players in your team roster at any time . If you 're not busy stealing players you can upgrade them as well with the experience points you earn from completing elements of the game .

Lima replaced a tired looking Thomson who had put in a tremendous shift but it was Dunfermline who almost sneaked a goal back when a drive by Ross smacked off the junction of post and crossbar . As if to rub it in , the Bairns showed how it should be done , ten minutes from time . The breaking Gow did brilliantly to delay his pass which released Anthony Stokes and once again , the Irishman was ice-cool as he rolled a shot wide of the diving McKenzie to put the game out of sight .
