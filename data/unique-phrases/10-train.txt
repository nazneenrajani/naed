A polyp that has been completely cut out will not itself recur but some people have a tendency to form multiple polyps so new polyps can grow after polypectomy . If an individual has four or more polyps , or one polyp of more than 1cm diameter or a polyp with severely abnormal cells ( dysplasia ) seen under the microscope , the risk of polyp or cancer occurrence is sufficient to warrant regular surveillance with colonoscopy . This is usually repeated every five or six years .
