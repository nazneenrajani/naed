It was an ideal race to judge the fitness levels for the start of the season . All 4 of us were in the 3rd wave , with Kelda in the fastest lane and Andy , Jim & Craig all in the same lane . With Turriff being a 20 metre pool this meant that the swim was congested and brutal .
I had a Saxo before , which was reliable and good on petrol , but this is reliable , comfy and cost effective ( I have done nearly 30,000 miles in it already ) . The roof with the spoiler is fantastic , and even in the fast lane you do n't feel any wind . I was one of the first people in my area to own a Tigra , and the staff could n't have been more helpful at my Vauxhall dealership .

Posted by Chas Hallett at 00:00 comments ( 0 ) December 15 , 2003 Motorway menace number two Category : On the road As promised , motorway menace number two , and a technique for dealing with it . You 're sitting in the fast lane , wanting to drive faster than the traffic in front of you , waiting patiently for it to clear and leaving a decent space to the car in front . Berk comes racing up behind you , flashes you to get out of the way and sits inches off your chuff .
30 . Get in the fast lane and gradually ... slow ... down ... to a stop . Then get out and watch the cars .
Mo and Myself ' could n't believe it . Here we were passing vans , cars and lorries and travelling in the fast lane of the motorway , two lanes further to the right than we had ever travelled with the Red Rocket . John Fargher had invited us to " The Goodall Institute " , as long as we took him there and back .
So this bike goes whoring past at about 120 . Two miles later same bike is pootering at 70 in the fast lane . So I have to slow down .

She thinks I 'm a big bone so I tend to go into my shell when I see her on the horizon . Milly , the hooligan , thinks I 'm pretty tame because I wo n't play ball with her like those humans do - such a waste of solar energy ! I 've known Alan for a long , long time .
Trebles all round ! Blair , like those before him , soon found that if you play ball with the Europeans , ( particularly the French ) , they are very likely to stick the bat where the sun do n't shine . Blair is now Billy no mates in Europe .
Newspapers were expected to print what the government wanted the reader to read . In fact , though this would appear to be a form of censorship , the newspapers of Britain , effectively controlled by the media barons of the time , were happy to play ball . They printed headlines that were designed to stir up emotions regardless of whether they were accurate or not .
2 Apr 2002 19:49 -- seti total : 1156 -- dnet : 37,559 So it is 11 ( possibly 12 ) days since my last post , why ? Because I am lazy and I was trying to get the Linux machine to play ball with the rest of the network , in fact to to this update I have had to do all sorts of odd configuration changes to the win98 machine . Soooo ... ... I did get the ISA 3com 3c509b into and working on the Linux system and I could ping either network card from this laptop and they could ping each other .
Waiting on further market setbacks Kelda has announced that it is to ask the regulator for permission to raise prices , using a standard formula that water companies do when they believe the case is warranted . It remains to be seen whether or not the regulator will play ball . If it does , the company 's profitability should improve somewhat and the potential for dividend growth may be enhanced .
Young Luke was buzzing ! With a new mag aligner rig on , the bait was launched back to the zone in an attempt to get a carp , but unfortunately they were not playing ball . In between runs we tied up rigs and Luke bombarded me with questions on baiting scenarios , marking , watercraft and just about everything to do with fishing .
We were also missing a couple of regular competitors , as there was an ACTC Council meeting on the day so the councils Technical Officer Simon Robson was occupied elsewhere . Andrea had some dramas the night before when her printer failed to play ball , refusing to recognise the four new cartridges that had just been installed . This was a big problem .
She opines that the glitterati were squeamish about some of the things the Tory campaign had to say , but Mark Austin is more interested in why Alistair McGowan does n't really do politicians . He then asks him what Tony Blair will be thinking , but Alistair is in a serious mood and wo n't really play ball . Never mind , there is more frippery from Gerald Scarfe , who shows off a cartoon of Blair disguised as , first , Bambi and then a USA poodle .
He knows how we should deal with food scares effectively and sensibly . However , his overwhelming case for reducing regulation without increasing risks to public health is heavily dependant on an insurance industry that may not play ball . And he is on less certain ground when considering the vexed issue of subsidies .
Now trading standards leaders are reminding football fans to be vigilant . Derek Allen , executive director of trading standards body Lacors , said : " Football fans should not play ball with these rogue traders .

David McEwen has released a new version ( v0.20 ) of his port of ColEm . It now runs fine on older machines ( pre-RISCPC ) and even my nice little A5000 will play ball ( albeit very slowly ) . There have been some tidy ups so it 's possibly very slightly faster .
And in any case every lobby group ' under the sun is currently trying to get their pet objective added to the CPA which , if successful would make the process even less useful than a dog 's breakfast .

Absolutely right , but achieving that is far more difficult than committing a strategy to paper . Marseille are refusing to play ball on the transfer of the excellent Frank RibÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â©ry , and with Arsenal sniffing around too , it seems unlikely that the Frenchman is Old Trafford bound .

[ Argues the quite credible case that the US can't afford to and don't want to overthrow Saddam because it would only strengthen Syria and Iran . Suter thinks the US government really wanted to find a means to rehabilitate Saddam but Saddam wouldn't play ball .

With the D100 housing wired up for DTTL the camera WILL NOT fire most ( probably all - certainly all the ones I have tested ) existing UW strobes , even with them set to manual .

If companies ever want new customers to call , they produce a separate number which never , ever has an automated system at the end of it .

Is there a concern that that could destabilise things on the Unionist side of the house , particularly in relation to the Loyalist paramilitaries and those who signed up to the fine balance that you achieved in 1998 ?

QUOTE If control of Iraqi oil is the issue why did Bush senior not simply drive on to Baghdad in GW1 . Good question and I do n't know the answer but maybe they believed Sadam would play ball with them all after bearing their teeth but he did n't so hence GW2 QUOTE If driving up Oil price is the issue he could have achieved more by attacking Saudi Arabia .

Redon explores the amazing scientific discoveries of his time , such as the ' monsters ' , which could be seen under the microscope . His fascination of the unconscious mind , dreams and fantasies was well ahead of Freud 's 20th century psychoanalytical analysis and his creations of the unknown world such as ghosts , the supernatural and the afterlife produce unforgettable images of the seemingly unknowable .
The huge regions of repeated DNA that dominate the Y chromosome are therefore free to accumulate extraordinary rearrangements by recombining with themselves . " If you look at the Y chromosomes of several different men under the microscope , they often appear different , " says Dr Jobling . " You see all sorts of funny-looking Ys : some with extra bits , some with bits swapped around or inverted , and others apparently missing bits .
Circular Crab The Black Tigress returned to Weymouth at approximately 16.00 . The majority of the molluscan material was taken by Graham Saunders for further sorting and study ( some under the microscope ) at various study institutions at home and abroad .

Mucoid enteropathies It 's been known for many years that young rabbits may develop a severe illness characterised by abdominal pain ; loss of appetite ; and production of jelly like material from the back passage .
It will eat all kinds of other animals but since it does not posses strong jaws it is unable to eat organisms with a hard shell . To photograph the whole animal under the microscope I used a young animal that was small enough . The reproduction of Leptodora differs slightly from other water fleas .
I have always been intrigued by geometry and patterns . Examining diatom frustules for the first time under the microscope , I was captivated by the perfection of their symmetry . It was through my motivation to find out more about the precise regularity in the simple , but perfect , frustule forms that I came across Johan Gielis ' Superformula , a fascinating concept that interlinks a number of shapes found in living organisms through variations on a single mathematical equation .
More precise urine tests are performed on a " MSU " ( mid-stream urine - a sample of urine sent to the laboratory for microscopic analysis ) . Under the microscope , the presence of white cells , red cells or clumps of cells - " casts " - is recorded - all possible signs of kidney disease . Finally , all urine sent to the laboratory is tested for bacterial infection .
Some sponges are very distinctive but others are notoriously difficult to identify from external features , and the shape and size of the spicules is an important diagnostic feature . Under the microscope the spicules look like little spears , hooks , anchors , stars and diverse instruments of medieval torture ! These , combined with toxic or distasteful chemicals , make them a very unpleasant mouthful for grazing animals .
Demodex criceti is easier to detect as it lives in the crevices of the skin surface . It looks short and squat under the microscope and can be easily scraped or picked up from a heavily infested animal 's skin . Demodex aurati is not quite so easy to find .
Sigmoidoscopy : this technique uses an instrument called a sigmoidoscope to see into your rectum . It enables the doctor to examine the walls of the large intestine and to take small pieces of tissue , called biopsies , to examine under the microscope .

Mineral grains record the history of a rock 's formation in their structure , visible if the rock is cut thin enough for light to pass through . We 'll find out how to ' read ' a rock under the microscope , and how to identify the minerals that comprise it to uncover its history . Britain 's Geology : Solving the Jigsaw Britain and Ireland have developed at a geological crossroads .
She came to hysterectomy and her ovaries were removed . The fibroids were benign under the microscope but they had a tendency to recur ( an extremely rare situation ) . When she was given HRT more fibroids appeared ( an extremely rare condition called benign metastasising leiomyomata ) but they regressed when the HRT was withdrawn .
Describe and name the main types of extracellular fibrous networks which are normally observed in connective tissue . Describe how a mast cell can be recognised under the microscope . List the main structural characteristics of adipose tissue .
Treatment for hepatitis C What treatments are available ? The most accurate way of assessing liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis C is by liver biopsy , where a very small piece of liver is removed using a special needle and examined under the microscope . This permits assessment of the grade , or activity , of the hepatitis ( the degree of inflammation ) and the stage of the hepatitis ( the amount of scarring or fibrosis present ) .
Home made adapter to bring the width of the slide to a standard 3 " . The sections themselves have been made to a reasonable standard but are spoilt by the sealing agent ( without coverslip ) which is far from optically perfect and gives the slides a slightly ' milky ' appearance and spoils them both visually under the microscope and photographically where a loss of sharpness and definition occurs . However that does not detract from my use of them to learn about rocks and minerals .
It 's a good idea to prepare a number of slides using the same chemical , and experiment with different heating and cooling regimes to see which combination gives the best effects under polarised light . Do n't forget to view some slides while they are crystallising under the microscope . The often rapid passage of colourful crystals across the field of view is well worth watching , and can be a challenge to video if you have the facilities .
How the images were made Light microscopy , where visible light passes through sliced tissues under the microscope , has been used for hundreds of years to visualise details unseen by the naked eye . Samples are often stained with specific dyes to pick out different aspects of the internal structures , and coloured filters can also enhance structures in the sample .
An incision in then made in the chest and the internal organs are removed and examined . Small tissue samples may be further examined under the microscope . Clear communications and written consent applies to the retention of tissue and body parts to both post mortems , those ordered by the Coroner and those agreed upon between relatives and hospitals .
What can be viewed in polarised light ? Try viewing the subject under the microscope using polarised light and see ! Focus the subject first with the filters off , then use the filters and turn the eyepiece to pass through the cross polar position .
For pilocytic astroytomas the primary treatment is surgery . Benign Tumours that have non-malignant appearance under the microscope and natural history . These tumours usually have slow rates of growth and have low infiltration into surrounding normal brain .
The corner supports each have a rubber ring for the base so give additional rigidity . A bonus is that a dust free area under the microscope is created which is handy for storage of items in use during a microscopy session , e.g. slides , spare objectives and eyepieces . The working area is quite large e.g. sufficient for external or bulkier connected lamps such as that shown on the Biolam below .
The birds are singing and looking for nest material and the catkins are out on the hazel trees . So why not join me for a walk to see what can be found for study under the microscope or hand lens ? Before you put your boots on , please read the important notes on collecting .

Research takes place at all levels . It can occur in the laboratory , under the microscope and in the test tube . It can be technological .
11 . While examining under the microscope , determine the degree of infection in each root piece . Consult the Infection rate chart ( below ) while carrying out this step .
Kim said : If you want to be really really sure that your pet has n't got any worms , take it to the vet for a health check . The vet may take a faecal sample and have a look under the microscope for toxocara eggs . But an easier way is to treat them monthly and then you do n't have to worry about it .
The action of Rcd blocks chromosomal genes but allows the expression of plasmid genes - small circular pieces of DNA - to continue , " explains Dr Summers . " When we looked at Q-cells under the microscope we found that the bacterial chromosome was highly condensed . This is similar to the formation of heterochromatin , which blocks gene expression in eukaryotes .
Peel off the dried layer of nail varnish by using sellotape and stick this onto a slide . Alternatively , with some plants you can peel off an epidermal strip directly , which you can mount in water on a slide and place under the microscope . If you have an eyepiece graticule which you can use , you can work at a relatively low power , and you can count the number of stomata within different squares to act as replicates .
Imperial College London What is it ? A bacterium which looks like small round beads under the microscope and which produces an armamentarium of toxins and surface proteins which combat the human immune system and also cause disease . It is also known as Streptococcus pyogenes , S. pyogenes , or simply group A strep .
The epidermis : This outer layer is mostly very thin ( about 0.1mm thick ) , except for the palms and soles , where it may reach as much as 1.4mm . Under the microscope , it can be seen to consist of several different layers -- though these are hard to detect in very thin skin . The innermost layer of the epidermis is called the basal layer ( stratum basale ) , where cell division occurs to make new skin cells .
The definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer 's Disease is by an examination of the brain after death . In 1907 a German neurologist , Alois Alzheimer , after whom the disease was named , looked under the microscope at the nerve cells of the brain of a fifty-six year old woman who had died after several years of progressive mental decline . He discovered tangles of fibres , likened to knotted ropes , which were not found in normal nerve cells .
It collects in aggregates or flocs around the edges . Under the microscope ( x400 ) it shows a filamentous alga with similar sized cells occasionally interspersed with a larger heterocyst - looking like a bead necklace . It is a species of Anabaena .
