Newspapers were expected to print what the government wanted the reader to read .

2 Apr 2002 19:49 -- seti total : 1156 -- dnet : 37,559 So it is 11 ( possibly 12 ) days since my last post , why ? Because I am lazy and I was trying to get the Linux machine to play ball with the rest of the network , in fact to to this update I have had to do all sorts of odd configuration changes to the win98 machine . Soooo ... ... I did get the ISA 3com 3c509b into and working on the Linux system and I could ping either network card from this laptop and they could ping each other .
Waiting on further market setbacks Kelda has announced that it is to ask the regulator for permission to raise prices , using a standard formula that water companies do when they believe the case is warranted .

Young Luke was buzzing ! With a new mag aligner rig on , the bait was launched back to the zone in an attempt to get a carp , but unfortunately they were not playing ball . In between runs we tied up rigs and Luke bombarded me with questions on baiting scenarios , marking , watercraft and just about everything to do with fishing .
We were also missing a couple of regular competitors , as there was an ACTC Council meeting on the day so the councils Technical Officer Simon Robson was occupied elsewhere . Andrea had some dramas the night before when her printer failed to play ball , refusing to recognise the four new cartridges that had just been installed . This was a big problem .
She opines that the glitterati were squeamish about some of the things the Tory campaign had to say , but Mark Austin is more interested in why Alistair McGowan does n't really do politicians . He then asks him what Tony Blair will be thinking , but Alistair is in a serious mood and wo n't really play ball . Never mind , there is more frippery from Gerald Scarfe , who shows off a cartoon of Blair disguised as , first , Bambi and then a USA poodle .
He knows how we should deal with food scares effectively and sensibly . However , his overwhelming case for reducing regulation without increasing risks to public health is heavily dependant on an insurance industry that may not play ball .

David McEwen has released a new version ( v0.20 ) of his port of ColEm . It now runs fine on older machines ( pre-RISCPC ) and even my nice little A5000 will play ball ( albeit very slowly ) . There have been some tidy ups so it 's possibly very slightly faster .
And in any case every lobby group ' under the sun is currently trying to get their pet objective added to the CPA which , if successful would make the process even less useful than a dog 's breakfast .

Shotgun weddings rarely work .

Absolutely right , but achieving that is far more difficult than committing a strategy to paper . Marseille are refusing to play ball on the transfer of the excellent Frank RibÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â©ry , and with Arsenal sniffing around too , it seems unlikely that the Frenchman is Old Trafford bound . Meanwhile the transfer of Mahamadou Diarra seems no nearer completion after United 's ÃŒÃ¢Ã¥Â£ 18m bid was turned down by his club Lyon , who have no need to sell .
It is not to be trifled with . Such trifling had been beaten out of my colleagues the scientists at a very early age : if the evidence wo n't play ball , then you do n't help it along . This is fundamental ; it is the scientist 's concept of sin .
[ Argues the quite credible case that the US can't afford to and don't want to overthrow Saddam because it would only strengthen Syria and Iran . Suter thinks the US government really wanted to find a means to rehabilitate Saddam but Saddam wouldn't play ball . I think they wanted to deal with a close associate who would replace him but resemble him closely - though preferably not Uday or Qusay ( someone resembling the grotesque array of defectors that keep popping up every so often ) .
" The IFPI wants internet service providers to warn customers illegally downloading that they risk their internet access being cut off .

They ca n't make any further charges if they are in breach of their agreement with you after you cancel , and you can instruct the tenant to deal with you directly .
With the D100 housing wired up for DTTL the camera WILL NOT fire most ( probably all - certainly all the ones I have tested ) existing UW strobes , even with them set to manual .

If companies ever want new customers to call , they produce a separate number which never , ever has an automated system at the end of it . Anyway , this one from T-Mobile was particularly stark because it effectively cut me off when I would n't play ball .

Is there a concern that that could destabilise things on the Unionist side of the house , particularly in relation to the Loyalist paramilitaries and those who signed up to the fine balance that you achieved in 1998 ?

The Arsenal DVD cardz ( due February 2005 ) will feature Robert Pires , Thierry Henry , Fredrik Ljungberg , Jose Antonio Reyes , Sol Campbell & Patrick Viera .

She checked out my site and forum and kindly sent me a snap of one of her paintings.....aboriginal boys cooling off in a waterfall .
