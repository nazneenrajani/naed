One study ( Encounters with unjust authority , Gamson , Fireman and Rytina 1982 , quoted in Atkinson et al , ( 1990 ) showed a considerable amount of rebellion on the part of groups .

That this war is not about oil is laughable . The US was very willing to have The Taliban control Afghanistan until it became obvious that the Taliban were not going to play ball with regard to the proposed pipeline carrying oil through Afghanistan .

Both days the sun shone , the winds stayed almost nil . If a few of the small Carp had played ball it would have been a fantastic day for the boys and girls . My thanks go out to Terry Barton , Roy Oliver , Ray Martin and Colin Read for taking time off to help .
This was probably one of the bravest decisions we ever made . Our fears were : would the suppliers play ball , would the suppliers improve their terms ; would the quality of service improve and the hardest of them all was , would the end-users support us ? Sometimes in procurement you have to take calculated risks .
In the longer term I 'll decide what I keep -- but first I need to list exactly what I 've got , and reunite long divided sets of this , that and the other .

You'll also need to secure his agreement but , as I said , ask him at the right time and that shouldn't be a problem . And if he won't play ball , you can always enter our competition to win all of the fabulous prizes we have selected . Come on England , as they say .

One year on and our civil liberties and human rights are going down the pan . The state/cops shoot first and ask questions months later , whilst the mainstream media plays ball .

In another twist to this sad tale , Swansea City 's creditors list include both the Football League and Carlton !

The next contract , with whichever TV Company , will be worth a fraction of the current contract to each League club .

For affiliate marketing to be successful it has to operate as a two way street , a partnership between affiliates and merchants .

It smacks of the toddler strops to me .
It uses Absolute Positioning and uses the recommendation that an Absolutely Positioned ( AP ) element will " calculate " its height from its containing block providing the containing block is not position : static ; ( default ) .

Big engined moderns and classics that did n't play ball I 've never had much joy with fuel calculations . The Series 1 Jaguar XJ12 L I had some years back was also fairly vague in its reported fuel levels , manys the time it coasted to a halt sucking only fumes from either of its twin tanks .
They wanted to fish well and really enjoy doing it . They had all been around carp fishing long enough to know that occasionally even if you put in loads of effort , fish really well and conditions are perfect , you can still be slapped down by Mr Carp refusing to play ball .

Luckily the bulk of individuals are in the pragmatic middle ground , if you give them a good reason to deliver up their data , and do n't abuse it , they just might play ball . There is a real budgetary imperative too .
Apparently I 'm not the only one with this problem though . I have an iMac G5 connecting to a Netgear wireless router and Tiger just refuses to play ball with the DHCP , the Airport keeps assigning itself an IP address . It works fine through Ethernet though - I guess I 'll have to wait for a fix .
A well-executed technique is very often visually striking to those who witness it . In a real fight , the opponent will not " play ball " in the same way a compliant practice partner would and hence the technique will not be as pretty in appearance . What is a graceful movement when performed in the kata , or against a compliant practice partner , will become rough round the edges when applied in an all out situation .
Start the GMS idea of points means prizes . Give the carrot MPIG so no-one loses out and they all play ball . Set the minimum targets of 25 % ( to get the ball rolling ) .
Nor did workers worry about using working hours to hunt down food and other necessities . If mangers did not play ball , the labour shortage meant they had no compunction about flitting from job to job in order to search out better conditions . Demoralised , hungry , badly trained and yet prepared to cock a snook at management , workers ' productivity was bound to suffer .
Do n't you know who I am ? Only the President of this whole fucking shitpile that 's who ' - or whatever the Arabic equivalent of that might be , and now he 's even decided not to play ball at all and turn to his own show trial . And so we come to Marcus over at Harry 's Place who 's clearly incensed by Saddam 's behaviour and worried that if he keeps acting up it might harm ' the credibility of the Iraqi judiciary and the legal process. ' ( ?
Something has to give .

If in doubt , check with your supervisor . We always have the sanction of removing people 's access to the network if they do n't play ball but we do n't enjoy doing this ! CLEANLINESS AND ORDER I tried to think of a title to this section slightly less reminiscent of Sunday School , ( " Control of Extraneous and Unidentifiable Materials on Working Surfaces " ?
Meghan O'Sullivan , a fellow at the Brookings Institution , said the best approach would be to give up sanctions which do not work in exchange for allied support for those which do . ` ` They should bargain away what 's not in place for what is in place , to show we are willing to play ball , ' ' she said . The United States could offer , for example , to let foreign oil companies invest in the Iraqi oil industry in return for a commitment that their governments would stick to the rules .
Continuing our vague theme of electricity , we got a science kit out this morning . Failed to demonstrate static properties with balloons which would n't play ball , but we had success with the circuits . Nothing really new today , I think it was just consolidation of stuff we 'd already covered by playing with the electronics kit , but it was fun anyway .
The difficulty for United now is that the Dutchman has his heart set on a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona , not Italy . At the present time neither Spanish side is playing ball , with Real Madrid in the middle of a Presidential election and Barcelona 's efforts focused on United misfit Diego Forlan . Ruud , it appears , has also decided to use the World Cup as a stage for his talents - a strategy that could back-fire for both the player and United should it all go wrong .
It 's a question of money which is easily overcome , but more important for me is to lose some weight . I 've set myself a goal of losing a stone by Christmas and I 'd like to lose another stone before I start treatment ( so that 'll be sometime in 2007 then ) Lisa - bummer about AF - she never plays ball does she ?

Christopher Chick and his girlfriend Helen Morris later retracted their evidence saying police put pressure on them . Mr Chick also said police had offered him ÃŒÃ¢Ã¥Â£ 5,000 for giving evidence against the men but was then refused it as he " had n't played ball " .

Just like all albums before , they manage to take you someplace and keep you there for the duration of the album . The title track of any album sets the tome and it 's up to the rest of the tracks to play ball . And in the case of Blue Bell Knoll ( the album ) , the effect is amazing .
Out have gone most of the troublesome Trots . The CPB wo n't play ball , the Greens have refused an electoral pact for the Euro elections , and the Socialist Party claims it 's all insufficiently socialist .

The first thing Paul says here is that you should " submit " . You should play ball , in so far as Caesar is not playing God . And that includes all that Paul talks about in verses 6 and 7 : This is also why you pay taxes , for the authorities are God 's servants , who give their full time to governing. { 7 } Give everyone what you owe him : If you owe taxes , pay taxes ; if revenue , then revenue ; if respect , then respect ; if honour , then honour .

That seems reasonable , does n't it ? Given that we agree with the principle of ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›Ã·the polluter pays ' this is OK in principle , but good landlords are treated the same way as the bad in the plans ( and if the bad do n't play ball , the good have to pay the bill , too. ) There are perverse incentives for local authorities to view this as a way of raising money . Designating an area will stigmatise it ( or even worse , glorify it for some ) and many , many other arguments of detail .
The execution of peaceful protesters by a brutal authoritarian state was captured on television , most notably with the iconic figure of ' The Tank Man ' , and resulted in worldwide condemnation .

A. You could have a claim on his pension however without all the information then it is difficult to advise . I would suggest that you go and see a solicitor who could perhaps write a letter to your husband to advise that you wish to seek a capital settlement and that you would consent to the petition if he agreed to play ball on the finances . Its not ideal but it could be a way of having matters dealt with .
DAMMIT why did n't the UK get all of Jus 's costumes ?
