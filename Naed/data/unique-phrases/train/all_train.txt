However , it is effective and while the story did n't move me in the way novels such as Sophie 's Choice or Midnight 's Children , it did leave me very angry and even more entrenched in my views that unfettered capitalism is a very bad thing indeed .

Unfortunately , with the passage of time , both his name and his shows are in danger of being forgotten .

Only then can the Ummah pro duce its own leaders who will lead it to the achievement of , its mission on earth - the establishment of justice ( adl ) .

ICT - these three letters can mean many things to modern foreign language teachers : enthusiasm to some , but concern , fear , and even loathing to others .

The first program was a jagged Ferris wheel that spun slowly ad nauseam on a yellow background .
It 's great to read Tony Campolo 's interview ( thanks to Jenee and textweek for this link ) in which he claims that Evangelical Christianity has been hijacked by the Religious Right , to support their political , social and economic agenda . But oh , it 's as if he 's having to walk on egg-shells , to avoid alienating any more of the constituency which are also his bread and butter .

While the UK stainless wire producers have indeed attempted to focus on these niche markets , they are not of themselves sufficient to permit profitable operations .

That requires becoming actively involved not only with keeping software secured and updated , but recognising and understanding Internet security trends as a whole .

Approach thigh touches and head touches the same way , but wait until they have some control with their feet so they can " dig " it up for a catch at the end .
Make your throws & carry the ball vertically to the height of the top of your head so that your forearm does n't get in the way of your eyes , you should be able to juggle & watch everything underneath your arm . When you make the horizontal carry stop completely before you drop the ball otherwise the momentum of the carry will throw the ball to the side rather than drop it straight down . There are several different ways of turning a Drop into Droppings .
He ran through astonishing feats at a blistering pace hardly giving the audience time to pick themselves up . Seven ring pirouettes , solid five club backcrosses , six clubs whilst bouncing a ball on his forehead , then dropping the ball into the pattern to continue with a seven object cascade before returning to the fountain with a headbounce by a flurry of seven backcrosses . Naturally after the final club was caught everyone in the audience was on their feet & having babies .
Crumlin United:0Queen 's :2(after extra time ) QUEEN'S should have gone in front but their finishing let them down . Their best chance came after 13 minutes when Crumlin keeper Connor McAuley dropped the ball but James Gilgun sent wide . Ian Curry hammered past the upright on 23 minutes for the home outfit , who were battling hard with Ryan O'Neill in midfield and John-ny Stewart in the centre of the defence doing well .
Foot cleared an inside ball . Ademola dropped the ball which number 7 pinched away from him and fed it easily to the midfielders who was unmarked . Number 2 easily nudged the ball against the swaying net prompting a Danish fan to start a red flare .
For me , there were far too many knock ons / dropped passes etc. From what I could see - this was due to players passing the ball rather than taking the hit . Leeds were up on Bedford and alot of the time , with the man receiving the pass being tacked at the same time - causing the player to drop the ball . Players were to slow to support a tackled player - leaving them isolated .
11 mins : New Zealand 6 - 0 Lions Carter drives the penalty over with ease . 11 mins : Carter dances past the gain line as Wilkinson clutches at straws ... but as he bears down on the try line , Carter drops the ball forward ! 15 mins : As the rain lashes into the ground like a crazed kamikaze , the Lions are under ferocious pressure .
Back to the rugby . Do you still think about dropping the ball in the World Cup final , when you were just inches from the line ? Of course I do and I wish I caught it .
A fantastic match saw both keepers in the thick of the action but it was 52 minutes before Allan opened the scoring for Montrose ( though with some suspicion of handball ) . Sheran then doubled the lead with another controversial goal , reacting quickest after his challenge had caused Lowrie to drop the ball . Alloa later got a consolation via a wicked deflection which was an unfortunate way for Montrose to lose their first goal in 581 minutes of football .
Sometimes this will work but we must all realise what the team is trying to achieve . Another option would be to drop the ball out pull the defence forward . This would create more space in behind them and allow your forwards to open the game up .
Andrew Mumford supplied a cross from the left . Flahavan , under pressure from Neil Sharp , should have caught it but he dropped the ball and there was Todd to poke home from close range for his second goal in three games . But another goalkeeping error - this time from Roger Freestone - allowed the Essex side to equalise in the sixth minute .
With the Robins very much in the ascendancy , Morell Maison introduced Stuart Blaik to the game in place of Primus on the hour mark . Reece 's free kick , that restarted the game following the substitution , saw Yeomanson , unchallenged , drop the ball into his own net and gift Stones the lead . Nathan Bailey replaced the injured Darby for his first game back since he broke his toe and this only gave the Stones defense more problems .
Attacking , defensive and other heading techniques have their own sections . The aim of the control header is to drop the ball to feet as soon as possible . Make contact with the ball in the centre of your forehead , and use your whole body as a shock absorber to cushion the ball .
Building on this lack of firepower , Halton were the first to draw blood . A high ball delivered from the left was caught by the Benson keeper , but a collision with his full back caused him to drop the ball , leaving Priestley the opportunity to bury the ball into an empty net to give the home side the lead . Whilst Halton still seemed the more comfortable through the middle , with Cpl Ben Sammutt instrumental in most of their play , the goal seemed to galvanise Benson into action .
Bradford took advantage within seconds as Henderson went through some feeble Quins defence to bury his way over . Bradford 's habit of conceding penalties and dropping the ball early in the tackle count undermined their efforts though and it was Harlequins who stepped up the pace to score . Leuluai stepped through some weak Bulls tackling to go over , and the Kiwi could have grabbed another minutes later but he put the returned Gafa 's short pass down as the pitch opened up for him .
Emphasise to the " heads " to vary their lead -- some fast , some slow , some sideways , some stopping , etc. I let one lead for about 20 seconds or so . Then , on a whistle from a coach , 2 drops the ball to 3 and becomes the head of the snake . The rattle ( 3 ) becomes the dribbler and the former head circles around to become the rattle .
When the skipper looked up to see the dog standing there , he said " Hello Caesar . " At which point Caesar dropped the ball down splat into a drum of dirty diesel , covering the skiper with the smelly stuff . The language that spurted out was ripe but Caesar thought it was fun .
This flexibility allows the Referee to make a decision based on the individual incident . If a goalkeeper goes down injured with the ball still in his hands , to restart the game , an astute Referee will drop the ball to the goalkeeper alone . If play is stopped because a dog has entered the filed , then two opponents can contest the dropped ball .
In the modern game , Referees discourage players from kicking lumps out of each other ; there rarely is little justification for a contested dropped ball . The procedure is simple in Law 8 : in a large number of cases , the Referee drops the ball at the place where it was located when play was stopped . The players themselves seem to appreciate this last vestige of gentlemanly behaviour , and it is rarely a problem .
A dropped ball does not have to be completed with a set number of players in attendance . In fact the Referee could drop the ball with no players around him . Therefore , Referees in such volatile situations as in the match you mention , would just drop the ball back to the goalkeeper ( or a defender if it was outside of the penalty area ) - after telling all of the attacking players to keep well out of the way .
The wicketkeeper ran up and ran back . He dropped the ball and then threw it to the bowler , who was n't looking . Eventually , and owing to no skill on anyone 's part , Ruef was run out .
He got an extra 20-30 very rapidly so that was an expensive decision . My guess is the umpire thought that if the keeper dropped the ball , then it ca n't be out . Only true if the stumps are broken by the hands without the ball .
Not good . Swansea players seem to have been practicing their ' dropping the ball ' skills . The processor is now doing the right thing , performance is slightly improved according to lmbench and things look better .
Lord no ! Meads went for every shot , dropping the ball at every opportunity he had , and retrieved and defended beautifully . Berrett just kept on playing long rallies , keeping the ball in play as long as he could , sending his opponent on walks around the park clockwise , anticlockwise , back and forth .

We ran stories in the local paper and Richard made an enormous breakthrough in interesting the LSE and Alistair Campbell in the project , and though them , to Tony Blair .

I was gutted , it was a proper run , line coming off the spool but I felt nothing , all I could think was that might be my only chance of the week and I had fluffed it . I laid the rod against the bivvy , it was six o clock and still dark , so I decided to get in the bag for an hour until it was light . I got up when it was light , had the obligatory visit to the bushes and then went to see if Barry had caught anything , he reported nothing so I told him about my miss .
" And he 's hoping to be reflecting on a win by Saturday tea-time . He said : " You just want to get [ the first game ] over and done with and the first three points of the season in the bag .

Saints returned from Ross-shire on Saturday with all three points in the bag but players and supporters alike were left frustrated that they had n't rung up their most emphatic win of the season . Leading 3-0 going into the final stages of the game , the home side scored twice to keep the fans on tenterhooks but the Saints front line 's clever use of the ball in the dying stages ensured that there was no late heart break .

Yet another route that wildfowling charts towards sound mental health is that the pursuit of wild fowl in wild places conditions us to coping with failure . Someone once calculated that a coastal fowler had a one-in-three chance of finishing a flight with a bird in the bag . Last season 's permit returns from my local estuary suggest that this was an over-optimistic view .

A Devils time out I think it is . Then we are away again , Coventry fans are starting to believe it 's in the bag before the Devils score with 20 seconds remaining . Mayhem in the crowd and on the ice .
The lead changed on each round at least once with each getting the better shift at some stage . Tom seemed to have it in the bag up the last beat but sailed into a ' hole ' on the way to the line and Nathan almost sailed past , Tom managed to get moving again to win that race , Simon held Peter off in forth place to secure second overall with Peter third . The silver fleet had 10 entries with Cameron Jones winning two of the three races .

The brown 7 ball went down on the next break and Bustamante dished up to level things . The next looked in the bag for Busta but after executing a tricky clearance he missed the 9 ball down the rail to present the rack to Pagulayan . Breaking for the match , the 1 ball went down for Alex but with no pot on the 2 ball he made a poor safety .

It may have escaped your notice that David Gill has been more vocal in recent months . With the Carling Cup firmly in the bag , the team winning and playing with panache , it 's tempting to believe that Sir Alex Ferguson 's focus now rests in preparing for next season .

Good wins against Leigh and Hull set up a Challenge Cup quarter-final with Wigan in front of a mammoth 20,004 crowd . Unfortunately with the game in the bag on a boggy pitch , a display of inept tactical kicking handed the Riversiders a late victory . Saints last hope of silverware went when they went down to Hull KR in the Premiership semi final .
I put my head down today from the flag and just enjoyed the race and the gap grew and grew . It was in the bag but mistakes can happen and Hector feels bad enough but that 's racing . The GSX-R1000 was superb and perfect to ride so I am disappointed , but hopefully we can make amends later in the week .

Barbara Keeley outlines ways to get out the postal vote After five years of trialling new methods of voting , providing a choice of convenient voting methods is increasingly seen as the key to increasing democratic participation .
The result was that some pupils believed they had thrown away the qualification by failing to do the coursework so they did n't bother to work for , or even attend , the exam . Others who did take the exam were getting lower passes than they need have done by failing to achieve those valuable " in the bag " coursework marks . So today Heartlands staff do everything they can think of , including running sessions outside curriculum time , to help students get coursework done .
A long Steve Lomas throw resulted in a goalmouth scramble , in which Sammy Youssouf had a shot blocked , but Nygaard made no mistake as his well-hit shot squirmed under Simonsen . With a goal in the bag , the home side played some patient football , with Stoke rarely launching a meaningful attack . The frustration of having to do most of the running must have got to City midfielder Dave Brammer on 24 minutes , and to concede a penalty with Cook going nowhere was absolute madness .
What was I going to take to the Weymouth gathering ? Well , apart from a few clothes there were quite a lot of other things required for the event - paperwork relating to The Folding Society , a few copies of " It 's in the bag ! " , cameras , and the computer with membership details .
But the win capped a season of disappointment in the league , as rivals Rhyl got the win they needed to lift the Welsh Premier crown . TNS had this game in the bag within the first eight minutes . A flurry of attacks produced a goal for John Toner when he raced on to a through ball from Steven Beck , found himself in the clear , and lobbed keeper Steve Goodwin from the edge of the box .
So , what is the latest in this infuriating fiasco ? Well , to be sure they would win the last election , Brown and Blair did agree on something - to bury pensions as an issue by appointing an independent commission - ' Yes Minister ' style - that would not report back until after the cat was in the bag for the third time . As chairman of the new Pensions Commission , enter Lord Adair Turner , former darling of the CBI and it must be said , not a man to play games with .
A year ago Albion were without a win and had amassed just three points from their opening nine games . This time they go into the international break with 16 in the bag . That in itself should quell any lingering disappointment about dropped points in Fife .
This race will be remembered as one of the great Tours , largely because Armstrong 's new air of fragility has guaranteed suspense right up to the race 's final weekend for the first time in 14 years . How the mighty fell Jacques Anquetil With five Tours in the bag , Anquetil was expected to go for a sixth in 1966 . He was weaker in the mountain stages , fell ill with pleurisy , and assisted a team-mate , Lucien Aimar , to victory .
At least we had not hit the ' wall ' and were all still very cheerful . The Raptor watch point at Welbeck was our next port of call. we knew we had no chance of Honey Buzzard as they have not returned for the past couple of years and we already had Osprey in the bag . Buzzard proved a bit harder than anticipated as one of our team could not see what the others could .

It was like a 2 and a half hour drive followed by a 30 minute hike uphill to a French version of Craigmore , albeit without the midges and the rain . We had to laugh ( eventually ) and got about 5 micro-routes in the bag . All in magnificent surroundings it has to be said .
Something must have stirred during this teacher training year ( Bath University ) , as I remember saying to another student that it was quite pretty and all that in Somerset , but I missed seeing a bit of cliff and crag . Jun 1979 : Ben Nevis ( 4A ) With Snowdon and Scafell Pike in the bag , I felt it was time to go for the big one . Took it seriously too , buying a one-inch tourist map .
This just shows the effect good managers ( as well as money ) can have at a club . Manchester United and Arsenal are rallying , but they are so far behind Chelsea at the moment it would seem the title is already in the bag for the team from south-west London . Roman Abramovich is boasting that Chelsea will dominate football for a hundred years : I cannot wait to see the decline and fall of this particular Roman Empire .
A group photograph at the trig point and then a jog downhill to the finish . First one in the bag , one and a quarter hours gone . Rocky was next , no hanging about the car park as the midges are starting to appear as the rain eases .

Woolsey 11th , Hamilton 12th , Knipe 16th . Paul Robinson and Davy Lemon looked to have the first 125GP race in the bag by their performance early in the race , but shortly after Lemon took control of the race , it was William Dunlop who overtook both riders entering turn two in one manoeuvre .

I would n't go as far to say I 'll stick my neck out and say they 'll definitely win it but definitely be there or there abouts . You wo n't even find Fergie saying that until they 've got it in the bag But we just need to be a bit more consistent , win more , keep winning our home games - or start winning our home games - and just a bit more consistency . RN : We could do with a Norman Whiteside !
Mighty England crush Paraguay World Cup in the bag by Janus Motsonius The England football juggernaut thundered to a stunning victory on Saturday , in the process crushing a hapless Paraguay who could do nothing but stand and stare in wae and wonder at Sven 's merciless sporting elite .

Public opinion is against this war , there are considerable reservations among US allies , and Iraq's neighbours contain populations overwhelmingly opposed . The backing of the UN is important to the White House , and it is not yet in the bag .

It was really hot and conditions were really tough . The car has really improved and I got some more points in the bag so all in all it 's been a really good weekend. Gareth Howell also performed well and secured the position of runner-up to Colin in both races . Gareth added : A great performance and I 'm really pleased for the team .
I knew I was close to the top now and decided to push on . When the snow slope finally broke out onto the summit rocks , I knew I had it in the bag . The afternoon storm had abated and I struggled the last half hour to the top .
If we take a glib assumption , that all teams will win their home games , the pressure put on a team playing away first is simple--you have to beat your opponents by more at home than your are beaten away . Simple enough , but if you 're at home first , once you have a win in the bag , you can just focus your attention on keeping the score down , defending your lead . The question is whether your team is stronger leading from the start or coming from behind .
The Oxfordshire number three is nationally ranked and proved far to strong for Roseanne and she was well beaten 3-0 . Warwickshire needed to win the next three matches and when Sophie led 2-0 having taken the games comfortably 9-2 , 9-1 it looked as if the first of those matches was in the bag . Sophie then lost the third 9-0 and was 3-7 down in the fourth and struggling and it looked as if Warwickshire 's quest for a finals place was over .
After a bit more exploring we found another building similar to the first one we found , again it has found a commercial use . With this one in the bag it was off to Debden . The radar station at Debden We 'd passed Debden on an earlier Airfield Hunting but did n't explore it at the time .
TNS finally got the goal their pressure deserved on 80 minutes , when Lawless fed Chris King who crossed for Marc Lloyd-Williams to head his 26th league goal of the season at the far post . Just when the points seemed to be in the bag , Cheesman caught Taylor in possession in the box . Rose fed Craig Williams free on the left and he fired his shot across Doherty and into the net off the foot of the far post .
A lot of people are probably wishing they could emulate him . 07/12/98 Juventas 1 - Galatasaray 1 - Shame really , it looked like the Italians had the game in the bag until 2 minutes into injury time when Galatasaray equalised . Probably just as well though .

Last minute television interviews by Don Touhig and Peter Hain glowed with the assurance of victory . One TV reporter assured me that he had been told by an Alun aide on the Friday night that a 5 % Michael victory was in the bag . There was one theme only , to shut the mouths of anyone who might criticise the fixes after the result was announced .
It 's in the bag ! Our P5 pupils interviewed the First Minister today .
The seventh saw Young tear into Bonavic again , with Bonavic trying to stay in close , working away as he did so . And so into the eighth , and a comfortable points win was in the bag as far as Gary Young was concerned , but he was intent on stopping Bonavic . A string of straight rights followed by a fantastic right hook and another straight in the middle of the round and it was indeed all over .

Benitez has no interest in Owen , or Joaquin , who he does not rate . Already in the bag are Argie centre-back Gabriel Palleta from Banfield , and Chilean winger Mark Gonzalez , who may be asked to play on the right despite being left-footed . On either flank , Gonzalez will be a major star .

Everyone else found it hilarious in the extreme , I was completely embarrassed and have not been allowed to forget it since -1 have lost count of the number of times I 've been told " it 's in the bag " .

The answers , according to the polls at the moment , would seem to be a clear , although less clear , ' yes ' and ' no ' . If the election is almost ' in the bag ' should the campaign , like last time , be based on safety first ? The 1997 campaign was compared to the agonising feat of carrying a hugely expensive antique vase from one side of the room to another .
Those moments of terror each side of half-time however turned out to be Stoke 's only worthy moments of the entire match . Incredibly and fantastically , by the hour , the game was over and City had 3 points in the bag thanks to two goals in two minutes to send us completely bonkers . Just before the goal rush , Peter Thorne so nearly scored throwing himself to meet an Ardley cross with a full stretch diving header , the ball just flying over .
Cameron pounced to hook in the rebound when Vio Ganea 's shot from a cross by strike partner Leon Clarke struck both the post and crossbar . Brighton could already have had the points in the bag by that stage as Wolves yet again struggled to carve out chances . Stefan Postma , making his league debut in goal for the visitors in place of the injured Michael Oakes , was much the busier of the two keepers .

The country had its own economic problems and was keen to have international sanctions relaxed ; and it was not anxious to involve itself in a new Irish adventure without the support of its old contacts , Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness .
On the edge of the mall shacks selling tea for a couple of pence , inside the mall western goods and plenty of designer labels . One member of the party 's collection of credit cards refused to play ball after he spotted a bargain . It later transpired that the shop had accidentally tried to charge ÃŒÃ¢Ã¥Â£ 14,000 instead of 14,000 rupees - around ÃŒÃ¢Ã¥Â£ 200 .
For affiliate marketing to be successful it has to operate as a two way street , a partnership between affiliates and merchants . Networks like Tradedoubler can do their best to help both parties , but unless the merchants play ball then the best content in the world wo n't earn me a penny . And that being the case I will be choosing my merchants very carefully from now on in .
Perhaps some HE-ers could band together and foot their own candidates - maybe the solution is standing and seeing how many people interested . Heather Says : April 16th , 2005 at 1:11 pm I understand the argument about not ' wanting to vote for any of ' em ' but sometimes this refusal to play ball only favours the likes of the BNP . It smacks of the toddler strops to me .
It uses Absolute Positioning and uses the recommendation that an Absolutely Positioned ( AP ) element will " calculate " its height from its containing block providing the containing block is not position : static ; ( default ) . Of course IE does n't play ball with this recommendation but we can use some of its little quirks to encourage the same effect. there is a " floaty " one coming soon too . .
Big engined moderns and classics that did n't play ball I 've never had much joy with fuel calculations . The Series 1 Jaguar XJ12 L I had some years back was also fairly vague in its reported fuel levels , manys the time it coasted to a halt sucking only fumes from either of its twin tanks .
They wanted to fish well and really enjoy doing it . They had all been around carp fishing long enough to know that occasionally even if you put in loads of effort , fish really well and conditions are perfect , you can still be slapped down by Mr Carp refusing to play ball . With everyone set up and in place it was only minutes before Geoff in peg 5 was away and blow me down whilst we were photographing a 10-8 , his other alarm burst into life !
The research defines segments of the population in relation to how protective they are ; pensioners in the lower socio-economic grades are most likely to be ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›ÃGuarded Privatist whereas those at the other end of the age spectrum are more likely to be ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›ÃOpen all hours . Luckily the bulk of individuals are in the pragmatic middle ground , if you give them a good reason to deliver up their data , and do n't abuse it , they just might play ball . There is a real budgetary imperative too .
Apparently I 'm not the only one with this problem though . I have an iMac G5 connecting to a Netgear wireless router and Tiger just refuses to play ball with the DHCP , the Airport keeps assigning itself an IP address . It works fine through Ethernet though - I guess I 'll have to wait for a fix .
A well-executed technique is very often visually striking to those who witness it . In a real fight , the opponent will not " play ball " in the same way a compliant practice partner would and hence the technique will not be as pretty in appearance . What is a graceful movement when performed in the kata , or against a compliant practice partner , will become rough round the edges when applied in an all out situation .
Start the GMS idea of points means prizes . Give the carrot MPIG so no-one loses out and they all play ball . Set the minimum targets of 25 % ( to get the ball rolling ) .
Nor did workers worry about using working hours to hunt down food and other necessities . If mangers did not play ball , the labour shortage meant they had no compunction about flitting from job to job in order to search out better conditions . Demoralised , hungry , badly trained and yet prepared to cock a snook at management , workers ' productivity was bound to suffer .
Do n't you know who I am ? Only the President of this whole fucking shitpile that 's who ' - or whatever the Arabic equivalent of that might be , and now he 's even decided not to play ball at all and turn to his own show trial . And so we come to Marcus over at Harry 's Place who 's clearly incensed by Saddam 's behaviour and worried that if he keeps acting up it might harm ' the credibility of the Iraqi judiciary and the legal process. ' ( ?
Something has to give . And I may have the solution , although I do n't know if work will play ball , so I 'll keep that under my hat for a bit until I 've discussed it with them , and blog you an update when I have . Comments ( 1 ) 9/2/2006 Bad Head Day Filed under : General -- Jenny @ 9:44 pm Hmmm , probably not surprising after the week I 've had , spent most of the day on the sofa with the curtains pulled and the tv on very low with yet another migraine .
If in doubt , check with your supervisor . We always have the sanction of removing people 's access to the network if they do n't play ball but we do n't enjoy doing this ! CLEANLINESS AND ORDER I tried to think of a title to this section slightly less reminiscent of Sunday School , ( " Control of Extraneous and Unidentifiable Materials on Working Surfaces " ?
Meghan O'Sullivan , a fellow at the Brookings Institution , said the best approach would be to give up sanctions which do not work in exchange for allied support for those which do . ` ` They should bargain away what 's not in place for what is in place , to show we are willing to play ball , ' ' she said . The United States could offer , for example , to let foreign oil companies invest in the Iraqi oil industry in return for a commitment that their governments would stick to the rules .
Continuing our vague theme of electricity , we got a science kit out this morning . Failed to demonstrate static properties with balloons which would n't play ball , but we had success with the circuits . Nothing really new today , I think it was just consolidation of stuff we 'd already covered by playing with the electronics kit , but it was fun anyway .
The difficulty for United now is that the Dutchman has his heart set on a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona , not Italy . At the present time neither Spanish side is playing ball , with Real Madrid in the middle of a Presidential election and Barcelona 's efforts focused on United misfit Diego Forlan . Ruud , it appears , has also decided to use the World Cup as a stage for his talents - a strategy that could back-fire for both the player and United should it all go wrong .
It 's a question of money which is easily overcome , but more important for me is to lose some weight . I 've set myself a goal of losing a stone by Christmas and I 'd like to lose another stone before I start treatment ( so that 'll be sometime in 2007 then ) Lisa - bummer about AF - she never plays ball does she ? Hope everyone else is ok too. __________________ Bec xxx IVF 1996 - Jack 22/05/97 IVF+FET 2001 -ve IVF 2004 - Scott 10/01/05 4 watch this space

Christopher Chick and his girlfriend Helen Morris later retracted their evidence saying police put pressure on them . Mr Chick also said police had offered him ÃŒÃ¢Ã¥Â£ 5,000 for giving evidence against the men but was then refused it as he " had n't played ball " . Barristers acting for Michael O'Brien , Ellis Sherwood and Darren Hall asked the three Appeal Court judges to rule that their convictions were unsafe because a confession by one of them could not be relied on .

Just like all albums before , they manage to take you someplace and keep you there for the duration of the album . The title track of any album sets the tome and it 's up to the rest of the tracks to play ball . And in the case of Blue Bell Knoll ( the album ) , the effect is amazing .
Out have gone most of the troublesome Trots . The CPB wo n't play ball , the Greens have refused an electoral pact for the Euro elections , and the Socialist Party claims it 's all insufficiently socialist .

The first thing Paul says here is that you should " submit " . You should play ball , in so far as Caesar is not playing God . And that includes all that Paul talks about in verses 6 and 7 : This is also why you pay taxes , for the authorities are God 's servants , who give their full time to governing. { 7 } Give everyone what you owe him : If you owe taxes , pay taxes ; if revenue , then revenue ; if respect , then respect ; if honour , then honour .

That seems reasonable , does n't it ? Given that we agree with the principle of ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›Ã·the polluter pays ' this is OK in principle , but good landlords are treated the same way as the bad in the plans ( and if the bad do n't play ball , the good have to pay the bill , too. ) There are perverse incentives for local authorities to view this as a way of raising money . Designating an area will stigmatise it ( or even worse , glorify it for some ) and many , many other arguments of detail .
The execution of peaceful protesters by a brutal authoritarian state was captured on television , most notably with the iconic figure of ' The Tank Man ' , and resulted in worldwide condemnation . But do people remember the Bobur Square Massacre , at the height of The War Against Terror when the west was prepared to break bread with any brutal dictator who was prepared to play ball ? .
A. You could have a claim on his pension however without all the information then it is difficult to advise . I would suggest that you go and see a solicitor who could perhaps write a letter to your husband to advise that you wish to seek a capital settlement and that you would consent to the petition if he agreed to play ball on the finances . Its not ideal but it could be a way of having matters dealt with .

I think what lies at the heart of our problem is that while I harbour secret ambitions to dress her like one of the Pevensie Sisters she wants to go out looking like Jodie Foster as she appeared in Taxi Driver .

So , one fish between us was a small return for our efforts , but we all enjoyed ourselves and I for one will be returning for another go .

The more honest , and perhaps the more complacent , accept the latter view ; those who believe in the former usually have someone to blame .

The standard of football was the best I have ever seen from the school in 6 years . Our strength was our ability to attack , play balls into open spaces and work some exceptional 1-2 manoeuvres with good thinking and understanding between players . What we need to work on is tackling and gaining possession from the opposition and " going for the ball " rather than watching what the opponents do with it .

There are two reasons for the condition of the player touching the ball ' before it reaches first or second bound . One , it proves that the player would have conveniently reached the position of the played ball in the absence of the accused player due to swift thought , anticipation , positioning and smartness . Secondly , the condition , denied a room for disagreements between the opposite sides on the question of ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›Ã·how close was the played ball to the opponent 's position ' ?
My great advantage , aside from being as tall as Michael Jordan , was the German passport I owed to my mother , which allowed me to compete for a job in Europe as a native .

The equivalent , perhaps , of drumming on a table to audition as a concert pianist .

The earlier mention of Kerouac was deliberate . It is one of the enduring themes from the books indirectly drawing from his own youth : the young kid with his head filled with dreams and schemes whiling away the days in the library , soaking up knowledge , fuelling the imagination before running off to play ball . This is not the dry academia of Karl Marx toiling away at economic theory in the British Library .

Yet vegan dogs suffer ear-mites and under the microscope , it is readily apparent that ear-mites , rather than being amorphous specks of protoplasm , have , in fact , faces with an impressive set of recognisable features . A vegan vetinarian would also flinch in horror when gazing into their cute little eyes .
The cone includes the whole area of the cervical canal where there might be abnormal cells . The cone of tissue is sent to the laboratory for examination under the microscope . When you wake up after the cone biopsy , you may have some gauze packed into your vagina to help stop any bleeding .
He had been hyperactive since infancy . His nose was almost completely blocked , and the nasal smear test ( a smear of the nasal discharge is made on a glass slide and examined under the microscope ) showed that his nasal secretions were crowded with eosinophil cells . He was deaf due to glue ear ( serous otitis media ) and he was very difficult to handle .
Flatworms ( Platyhelminthes ) are simple animals . If you observe a flatworm under the microscope you will notice that it is completely covered with tiny hair-like cilia . The beating of these cilia propel the organism forwards , a bit like the ciliates only the flatworms are much bigger .
Balloon catheter : An inflatable plastic cylinder mounted on a thin tube and used for dilating narrowed areas of the intestine . Biopsy : Removal of small pieces of tissue from parts of the body ( e.g. colon - colonic biopsy ) for examination under the microscope to diagnose disease , or determine disease progression . Bulking agent : An artificial form of fibre made into tablets , granules or a power ( to be mixed with water ) .
You can find out more about inherited or ' familial ' breast cancer from the link below . Diagnosis Hyperplasia is usually found by chance at the breast clinic when the tissue from a biopsy or breast surgery is examined under the microscope in the laboratory . Treatment If the type of hyperplasia you have shows no increased risk of breast cancer in the future you will not need any treatment or follow-up .
The events are run by members of our staff , assisted by our committee and volunteer members . As we are all professional geologists , or very knowledgable amatures we are able to answer any questions about rocks & fossils , there is also the opportunity to look at rocks & fossils under the microscope and to bring in specimens for identification . As well as being a fun family event , it is educational .
The plants and flowers we often take for granted take on a whole new perspective if their colours , textures and shapes are enjoyed at a larger scale . Just getting closer to inspect by eye can reveal some detail , but more can be seen by using a 10X hand lens or studying subjects under the microscope . A few common garden and wild Spring flowers in the UK are examined here a little more closely .
Large Cell Lung Cancer Type of lung cancer . Named after the large rounded cells that can be seen when this type of cancer is looked at under the microscope . Large Loop Excision Small operation to remove abnormal pre-cancerous cells from the cervix .
When a gene mutates it is preserved to the degree that it is advantageous to the future of the species and to the degree that the creature with the mutation passes it on . You can see it happening under the microscope . Intelligent Design is balderdash .
These are expensive but do benefit all members of the group . Large models are used to help understand the overall arrangement of objects viewed under the microscope . Swell paper produces raised diagrams from computer generated drawings .
You may hear your doctor talk about the ' grade ' of your cancer . This means how well developed the cell looks like under the microscope . The more the cancer cell looks like a normal cell , the more it will behave like one The more normal a cancer cell looks , the lower its grade The more abnormal or less well developed a cancer cell is , the higher its grade Cancer cells are usually classed as low , medium or high grade .
If after all these tests it seems that the bleeding is coming from the kidney , then a kidney biopsy may be suggested . This test involves taking a very small piece of kidney tissue and examining it under the microscope . Things that suggest that diseases of the kidney may be the cause of the bleeding include : protein in the urine ( proteinuria ) high blood pressure abnormal blood tests of kidney function What is the treatment ?
Fatty liver The best way to explain about fatty liver is to show you some pictures . On the top / left below is what a normal liver looks like under the microscope . When you drink too much each individual liver cell develops a little ball of fat inside it .
In most cases , a needle biopsy will be taken for microscopic examination . Under the microscope malignant tissue can be identified and the degree of differentiation assessed . Differentiation is the process in which embryonic cells , which have a generalised structure , become specialist cells such as liver cells or skin cells .
The ray florets have been removed to show the detail in one of the inner phyllaries . Under the microscope a stigma is an attractive orange-yellow colour , and pollen grains are visible on its surface . The bi-lobed stigma is held aloft by the style , a column that has randomly located red spots on its component cells .
The computer software then puts all the images together to form an image of the whole cell . This is then rotated through 90 degrees ( it is lying flat under the microscope ) and projected as it is seen now . Images were taken on a Zeiss LSM510 Confocal Microscope .
The renal artery on the left ( the right side of the picture ) is blocked , while that on the right is narrowed . Kidney biopsy A kidney biopsy involves taking a small sample of kidney through a needle to look at it under the microscope . More information about this test is given in our page on renal biopsy .
A walking tour of the City centre to see the wide variety of rock types used in modern and historical buildings around the centre of Exeter , conducted by Roger Taylor ( formerly of the BGS ) , was also well attended , concluding a fun and interactive week of rock-focused science . Louise M Hollick BGS Exeter The Hidden World of Rock : textures and colours in rocks at close range , revealed under the microscope .
Left : photograph of an MCP measuring approximately 35mm across , and only three quarters of a millimetre thick . Right : seen under the microscope , the tiny pores ( each about 2 hundredths of a millimetre across ) become visible . Compare this image to that of the lobster eye shown earlier .
What causes nephrotic syndrome ? It is divided into a number of types according to the appearances of the kidney under the microscope . Some have known causes such as rare allergic reactions to medicines , infections like Hepatitis B , and diabetes .
Imagine putting a leaf flat on a surface and cutting across and then looking end on at the cut edge . The image on the left shows what you would see under the microscope if you took a very thin slice from that cut edge . Unfortunately , without access to sharp blades or a microtome , it can be quite hard to get thin enough sections to view the cut surface in detail .
This is the miles per division ( MPD ) ratio and is used for allocating the 10 nautical mile equivalent filter mesh blocks . These are the standard filter mesh lengths used for plankton analysis under the microscope . The required MPD ratio is achieved by setting the pitch angles of the CPR impeller blades .
Occasionally , the cause of indigestion is an ulcer and it is now known that many ulcers are due to bacterial infection in the stomach . A biopsy ( a small piece of the lining of the stomach ) may be removed during an endoscopy and examined under the microscope in the laboratory to pinpoint an infection . A very small number of patients with indigestion will turn out to have cancer and , again , the diagnosis can be made accurately by biopsy .
They can estimate the width of the hair by laying it on a ruler and judging size on the millimetre scale . A reasonable approximation can be made using a clear ruler under the microscope . Another idea is to photocopy graph paper ( with mm squares ) onto thick acetate and cut it to make graduated ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›Ã·slidesÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›Âª .
Drosophila ( fruit flies ) are routinely knocked out with CO2 to be observed under the microscope . Heather filmed a selection of flies waking from their slumber .
When gluten comes into contact with the lining of the small bowel , a reaction occurs , where the immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of the bowel as if it was a ' foreign ' organism . The small bowel has ' villi ' , which are tiny finger-like projections , visible under the microscope ( see Figure 1 ) . They provide a large surface area , over which we absorb nutrients , such as vitamins , folic acid , iron and calcium .
Loss of cells from the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain leads to shrinkage ( atrophy ) of these areas that may be visible on a brain scan . The brain changes have also been studied in post mortem examinations when the brain can be examined under the microscope ( ÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›ÃhistologyÃŒÃ¢â€°Ã›Â ) . Several different types of brain changes can cause the same symptoms .
Notice that each flower has a very long stigma-style that projects out a considerable distance . Under the microscope , dark-ground illumination reveals the details of one of the darker anthers and its filament . The image below shows both anther types .
These tumours usually have slow rates of growth and have low infiltration into surrounding normal brain . Under the microscope these tumours have relatively normal appearing cellular structures and infrequent signs of division ( mitosis ) . Brain Metastasis Tumours that have spread to the brain from outside the brain .
What tests will I need ? It is sometimes possible to scrape off a scabies mite , and view it under the microscope . However , if the rash has spread , and there are many scratch marks , it may not be possible to find the mites .
In most cases your specialist will be able to tell if the tumour in the brain is from the breast . On very rare occasions it is necessary to have a biopsy of the tumour taken to confirm the diagnosis under the microscope . More information Secondary brain cancer symptoms Secondary brain cancer treatment Living with secondary brain cancer Still have a question about this ?
Insect and their next of kin are very nice subjects for a closer examination under the microscope . But because of their size it is not possible to observe a life insect under the normal microscope .
The most important test however is a renal biopsy . This test is designed to take a small piece of kidney to look at under the microscope . It is done with local anaesthetic and involves putting a needle into the kidney through the back ; a scanner is used to find the kidney so the test is done in the X-ray department .
I did n't do this though because I wanted to test off several size patch stops quickly until I found the right size . So I just stuck it on with sellotape , judging and adjusting how centred it was , by swinging the filter holder back into place and looking at a specimen under the microscope . I re-cut the disk and re-centred it several times until I got one to achieve the dark ground effect .
Biochemical studies suggest that the abnormal cells are of B-cell origin . Hairy cells are so called because their cytoplasm has long projections or ridges which give them a very distinctive ' hairy ' appearance under the microscope . - back to top What are the major symptoms of leukaemia ?
Phytoplankton are identified to different taxonomic levels depending on the organism. ii . Zooplankton " Traverse " The filtering and covering parts of the silk are laid out under the microscope and a complete traverse of both sides is carried out which equates to examining 1/49th of the 10 mile sample . All organisms seen are counted and identified during the traverse .
Further polyps can develop however . The risk of recurrence is greater if any of the initial polyps was over 1cm diameter , if the original polyps were multiple ( four or more ) or if any of the polyps show severe dysplastic ( pre-cancerous ) change under the microscope . In these cases , colonoscopic surveillance is usually recommended every five or six years .
" This is founded in Sydney Brenner ' s vision , in setting up the worm project -- an entirely new system for developmental biology . My contribution to this was learning to watch the cells dividing , and sometimes dying , under the microscope . We could actually see programmed cell death in action , so beautiful , so clear and so reproducible .
For both procedures , the colon needs to be cleared by quite vigorous purgation ( medicines are given to stimulate the intestines and clear out the bowel ) , which many patients find the most unpleasant aspect of the procedure . There are advantages and disadvantages of each approach : colonoscopy allows biopsy and therefore the presence of cancer can be confirmed under the microscope . But , even in skilled hands , the whole colon is seen in only about 90 per cent of procedures .
Inflammation of these filters is called glomerulonephritis . It is a common cause of a severe but treatable kidney disease called crescentic nephritis , because of the appearance under the microscope . This is also called rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis ( RPGN ) because of the speed with which it can cause kidney failure .
Aims and Objectives : To extend the Level 1 treatment of sedimentary rocks , minerals ( ESC102 ) and depositional environments ( ESC101 and ESC103 ) . It is intended that the students should gain an appreciation of sedimentary rocks at the micro level through a study of minerals and textures under the microscope . Skills in mineral identification and texture description will be taught .
Not everything that moves is motile ! Under the microscope , motile bacteria seem to move in a purposeful way , though they may frequently change direction - look at the videos above to see this . However , even dead cells such as those in the video below ( killed with disinfectant ) move .
The zebrafish is a vertebrate , like mammals , and it has equivalent tissues and organs to mammals : for example , it has , heart , liver , kidney . A single adult pair of zebrafish can lay many hundreds of transparent eggs , and we use these eggs to look at the rapid development of the embryo under the microscope . A beating heart can be seen , without using intrusive methods .
Directions for preparing micro specimens of these crystals have been taken from the original reference ( 1 ) and adapted for growth on a microscope slide ( 2 ) . These crystals are very interesting and unusual specimens to observe under the microscope in both regular and polarized light . Procedure : Prepare a 10 % solution of potassium sulfate by dissolving 10 grams of K 2 SO 4 in 90 ml of deionized water .
Follicular Large Cell Type of lymphoma . The lymphocytes appear large under the microscope and are grouped together . This is an intermediate grade lymphoma .
Now look further afield , first immediately around the bronchus , and then all over the section . Compare the normal and patchily inflamed lung , both with the naked eye and under the microscope . Bacterial infection beginning in the respiratory tree has provoked an inflammatory response and many leukocytes , mainly neutrophils , have migrated from the blood into the lung .
Tests Diphtheria is diagnosed on clinical grounds , and by throat swabs . The organism can be seen under the microscope and also grown in the laboratory , although this requires special growth conditions . Tests can be done to determine whether the diphtheria bacterium produces toxin .
Now change from the right hand tool to the tool whose offset is to be measured . Use manual axis control to align the tool tip under the microscope . Read and note on paper the X and Z values from the co-ordinate display .
Too little and it does not cause triploidy whilst too much pressure kills the eggs . It is difficult to judge the success until the fish can be sampled and examined under the microscope , or mature as adults . The triploid eggs go on to hatch and grow normally into adult fish .
As another idea , Evans Blue can be included in solutions being used to plasmolyse plant cells , such as those of an onion skin . It should immediately be apparent to students examining the cells under the microscope , that the space between the retreating cell membrane and the cell wall is being filled by the ( blue-coloured ) bathing solution . The stain will , incidentally , reveal the occasional dead cell amongst the living ones in the onion skin .
THREE IMPORTANT NOTES : 1 ) The optical effects produced by the COL stops , are not always correctly recorded by all digital cameras ( mine is one of those ) . What one sees under the microscope is much better than the photographic image . Paul James with a camera and equipment many times better than mine , experiences the same problem .
In RA , the developing red cells in the bone marrow are unable to process the iron that normally goes into the haemoglobin . In cases of RARS , the iron may be deposited inside the red cell to form a characteristic ring that can be seen under the microscope . These two forms of anaemia , RA and RARS , are the most common forms of MDS .
What feature of the microorganisms suggests that they could carry out photosynthesis ? When you have looked at the algae and answered the questions above , make a hanging drop of protozoa and look at them under the microscope . Draw some of them and then answer the next group of questions .
I was three days into a typical end-of-winter cold , and feeling miserable . My attempts to examine some pond water under the microscope were being frustrated by a profusely running nose . In a sudden flash of inspiration , I allowed a drop of the mucus to fall on a clean slide , and gently placed a coverslip over the drop .
7. Cover with a cover slip , and blot firmly with several layers of tissue or filter paper and press gently to spread root tips . 8. View under the microscope ( x400 magnification is adequate ) and look for cells with chromosomes . Questions 1. The cellulose walls of plant cells are held together by compounds in the middle lamella .
Polysiphonia , a red algae - a very attractive algae with a fascinating life cycle . Pollen - seen under the microscope Microscopic fragments of Mesozoic conifer wood found in the Kimmeridge Clay and Purbeck sediments - the types of wood found in sediments can reveal an insight into the vegetation million of years ago . Horsetails : relic plants from prehistory - a common group of plants which are easily overlooked , but they have plenty of fascinating macro and microscopic features .
When we study aquatic subjects under the microscope we often encounter a familiar problem . If we use a very small drop of water , evaporation quickly reduces the volume and for sea water , the increase in salt concentration and resulting crystallisation can kill the critters .
Sarcoids around a horse 's eye - often referred to as " periocular " Is the lump on my horse a sarcoid ? A definitive diagnosis can only be made by looking at a biopsy , or tissue sample , under the microscope . This needs to be sent off to a laboratory .
These tumours are usually treated with surgery . Histologically ( under the microscope ) these tumours are usually benign but can have atypical or even malignant features . Radosurgery is an option to boost regular radiation or by itself to treat the ependymoma .
Summary of Requirements : Old 35 mm camera like Zenith Old B+W enlarger Paper developer and fixer Jam jars for fluids Red light Gum tragacanth Dark days of winter Black and white photographic paper . The paper should be first examined under the microscope for texture . Matt is the best material , but straight gloss is better than the modern papers that have all manner of reflective bits in the surface under the microscope these can be very distracting .
But as I mentioned above one must choose carefully the preparations which can succeed . Daphnia , alive , 4x , 12.5 DFS You must regulate very finely the brightness , with the camera software , to record a true black background and to give to the subject the colour and detail which it shows under the microscope . It may be that you must decrease the contrast to capture the true texture of the objects .
) . With a needle it was quite easy to cleave tiny mica flakes from this area of the rock and study under the microscope . The image above right shows one of these mica flakes under the microscope between crossed polars ( 3.5x objective , flake ca .
Any signs of abnormality should be investigated by a veterinary surgeon . It will help if you take a fresh sample of cloacal excretion for him to examine under the microscope . FEEL along the legs for any unusual lumps or swellings ; abscesses are common in reptiles and if left untreated can result in loss of limb or even death .
This is called an induced sputum test . The samples are sent to the laboratory and stained with special stains that make the organism visible under the microscope . How is PCP treated ?
Pheasants were , of course , imported from China where there were special breeds reserved for the emperors . These feathers are striking under the microscope and one can spend many hours studying them . Another one of my favorites is the feathers of ducks , wood ducks in particular .
To prepare a sample for study , a very small quantity of the compound was dissolved in several millilitres of room temperature distilled water and a couple of drops of the solution were transferred to a microscope slide . After the water had evaporated , the slide was examined under the microscope to check the quality of the result . Since the crystal structures tend to be fairly large , low power objectives are usually sufficient , and no cover-glass is required .
They were the flowers of the mountain thistle . Under the microscope he saw that they were covered with thousands of tiny hooks that attached themselves to fur and fabric . Much labour later he had developed Velcro , from the French velours ( loop ) and crochet ( hook ) .

The internal surface is completely vitrified , glossy , and smooth . A small fragment examined under the microscope appeared , from the number of minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles , like an assay fused before the blowpipe . The sand is entirely , or in greater part , siliceous ; but some points are of a black colour , and from their glossy surface possess a metallic lustre .
Minimise slippage in the grips by ensuring a balanced gripping load is applied to both sides of an end-tab and at both ends of a specimen . Align specimens to the axis of loading by orienting the fibre under the microscope . Ensure residual load after tightening is removed and that the zero load monitored length is measured .
Sep.98 Oblique illumination - or why having the mirror or condenser out of alignment sometimes helps ! Apr.98 Oblique and axial illumination - can be used to study opaque subjects under the microscope . Apr.99 Circular oblique lighting Part I - an interesting variation on lighting which has benefits for some subjects .
The reverse side of an anther , with the point of attachment to the filament , can be seen below . Under the microscope , this point of attachment seems remarkably fragile . Notice the pollen grains clinging to the anther 's surface in the image to the right .
Plus an easy to make portable microscope . Feb.99 Oblique and axial illumination - can be used to study opaque subjects under the microscope . Apr.99 Notes on adapting microscopes for phase contrast - Apr.99 Adapting a flash gun for photomicrography - a simple but effective adaptation of a flash gun for photomicrography .
Reprecipitated salts are also less frequent . Deposits at Kilise Tepe exhibit more variation in structure under the microscope , than was perhaps evident to me in the field . Calcareous spherules c. 50-200um in diameter are generally more common at Kilise Tepe than at Tell Brak .
The huge regions of repeated DNA that dominate the Y chromosome are therefore free to accumulate extraordinary rearrangements by recombining with themselves . " If you look at the Y chromosomes of several different men under the microscope , they often appear different , " says Dr Jobling . " You see all sorts of funny-looking Ys : some with extra bits , some with bits swapped around or inverted , and others apparently missing bits .

Although this system is more complex , it can give more precise information about the tumour stage . If the cancer comes back after initial treatment it is known as recurrent cancer. back to top Grading Grading refers to the appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope and gives an idea of how quickly the cancer may develop . Low grade means that the cancer cells look very like normal cells ; they are usually slow growing and they are less likely to spread .
The effect of elastase , when given into the airways of rat and mouse , is to cause Inflammation and destruction of the airway tissues . Events we can assess as changes In the function of the airways , similar to that seen in the disease in man , and under the microscope by examining tissues removed from the animal post mortem . We have also developed a model which mimics the influx of inflammatory cells into the airways similar to that seen in COPD in man .
Treatment options depend on the size , site and number of BCCs present . Following removal , the tissue is sent away to be examined under the microscope . It may take up to two weeks for the biopsy results to be ready .
No. 25 Eggs - of sorts has the following text : She is dowdy , she is despised-nay , more-her life is frequently in danger , for the careful housewife holds her in abhorence . Seen under the microscope , however , her eggs , with their sculptured surfaces , show an irridescent beauty-so that after all there 's something to be said for the Common Clothes Moth ! No. 1. Hidden beauties .
Note that for cocci , it is not just the shape and colour of the individual bacterial cells that is important , but the way that all these cells group together too . Put simply , round purple balls that look like bunches of grapes under the microscope ( i.e . Gram-positive cocci in clusters !
Not all pre-malignant changes progress to cancer : sometimes spontaneous return to normality may occur . Cells scraped from the cervix ( cervical smear ) can be analysed under the microscope and pre-malignant changes can be recognised . An estimate of the severity of change is generally reported ( mild , moderate or severe dyskaryosis or dysplasia ) .
The operation is simple and usually done as a day case . The lump is routinely sent to the laboratory for examination under the microscope . Removing a fibroadenoma causes no harm to the breast and wo n't affect the ability to breast feed .
These are collectively called autoimmune diseases . When examined under the microscope , the inflamed artery will be seen to contain increased numbers of a specialised type of cell of the immune system , the ' giant cell ' , which gives this condition it 's name . Giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) is considered to be a condition within the spectrum of the more general condition called polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR ) - of which giant cell arteritis is the more severe form of the illness .
The remainder of the week was spent with Prof. Ed Derbyshire , looking at various aspects of glacial sedimentology . Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the two days ( in my view anyway ) involved looking at till micromorphology , both under the microscope ( thin sections ) and with the SEM . Other aspects of the unit included detailed lectures about till fabrics and whether or not fabric analysis can elucidate transport pathways ( the group were divided ) .
Notes and References . 1. " Atlas of sedimentary rocks under the microscope " . This excellent full-colour handbook by A.E. Adams , W.S. MacKenzie and C. Guilford 1984 , published by Longman , has an appendix on the staining of acetate-peels .
